 lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr . bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr . collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st . james ' s .  	59.94383162751568

 it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .  	67.93847489345053
 lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .  	90.75798888021205

 that mr . bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr . bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings .  	53.57770251131448

 it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit .  	83.40907525942082
 she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .  	107.16092505182509

 during dinner , mr . bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .  	54.3051896206217

 a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .  	60.118936779472314

 people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .  	154.84577724112182
 she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be .  	56.7017438267529

 elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .  	75.47746267388173
 though darcy could never receive _ him _ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .  	66.99720360043634
 " what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia  	97.7112623674877

 i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .  	45.81739635576729
 there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .  	44.80457580594146
 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully .  	33.47596531693122
 this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .  	80.53386117885739

 _ their _ situation was awkward enough ; but _ her ' s _ she thought was still worse .  	88.32898039932412
 she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .  	59.50862639698864
 mr . bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .  	53.17260589770927

 jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare .  	76.86236284177691
 " i leave it to yourself to determine said mr . bennet .  	34.8624490526524
 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration .  	62.3727872057271
 elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .  	81.47401541479798
 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .  	72.46392423386266
 she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .  	55.81020354248294

 " some time or other he _ will _ be but it shall not be by _ me  	105.63824492520716
 she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .  	44.38797590544803

 it was mr . collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .  	51.60460333633732
 " it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on .  	59.145769253241625
 where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .  	95.21244096308668
 " i am far from attributing any part of mr . bingley ' s conduct to design said elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .  	45.3809116573264

 his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .  	66.01390488713801
 and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north .  	34.392850005722366
 hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .  	60.18452838183822
 sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .  	141.19498735336188
 " you are over scrupulous surely .  	33.200148177163875
 it became her turn to listen .  	47.2938078113102
 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .  	74.26849978443717
 his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .  	43.908159659522006

 this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .  	155.59351135871728

 the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .  	70.44497414980265

 elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .  	48.550432467286925
 in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .  	69.58468625367665
 in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .  	87.99622404630153

 her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .  	76.79631619409956
 had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .  	65.53392154210394

 she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .  	63.11593589464651

 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone .  	60.65968715335614
 darcy mentioned his letter .  	62.86970651668393

 " at four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman said mr . bennet , as he folded up the letter .  	53.21618972439191
 " and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently .  	63.87702798177977
 " she is a very fine looking woman !  	49.66795523316018
 she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr . darcy .  	51.24499689012355
 this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .  	81.25608634762844
 she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .  	67.41223558210055
 upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .  	79.48099020740787
 and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ?  	61.17781142640487
 nobody wants him to come .  	68.24008021313375

 " upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for <URL>  	65.58331624213518

 it is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .  	58.16634853475654

 with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .  	48.92304960207967
 pemberley was now georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see .  	52.76919435278397
 <URL>  	17.642663217494775
 at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .  	51.39638473152393

 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly <URL>  	87.79942452558844

 i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .  	36.64665590604301
 one day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .  	60.14342392552627
 " my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you .  	33.87843693899874

 " an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth , " but it will not do for _ us  	56.99504070825341
 eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .  	66.398883635455
 " good gracious !  	16.05231631738426
 darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable <URL> cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before <URL>  	76.26180908720796
 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs . bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .  	76.1862177033246
 but i am at his disposal .  	26.69015745917881
 he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .  	63.01990061941425
 the supposition did not pain her .  	32.20192614754438
 she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .  	38.71107713330872
 wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .  	46.3985226788023
 as a child i was taught what was _ right but i was not taught to correct my temper .  	105.30798373443017
 but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .  	82.73259457292194

 her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .  	68.57948861844967
 he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .  	36.51104353560764

 jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .  	66.68004912658935
 lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia .  	51.79790095202714

 elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think <URL>  	24.37830574521296
 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr . wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr . darcy ' s looks and behaviour .  	39.37054130978769
 when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .  	72.75857877227148
 she shook her head .  	21.224390538320105
 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .  	65.8231778850492
 as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?  	101.26653280714426

 their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .  	72.06502916095918
 but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs . long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack <URL>  	44.892505588207705
 what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?  	78.13663408327322
 bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .  	61.444205837035696
 elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .  	57.7114308926764
 elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .  	37.178614153846475
 had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .  	77.49083769822457

 his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .  	56.526733820561084
 it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .  	56.04962070726445
 i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name .  	85.05637556832845

 he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .  	43.089778439028144

 and what can _ he _ have to say  	42.76219983622553
 even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .  	88.37377178694882
 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .  	61.520422407010145
 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .  	69.22536244965141

 the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _ her  	91.09130606787389

 mrs . bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr . collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr . bennet , and prepared for backgammon .  	59.71148685949209
 without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .  	60.10336343462656

 in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr . collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr . collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .  	64.31132698965142

 " miss elizabeth bennet  	78.92626943100586
 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr . darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .  	64.71142600440503
 that he was _ surprised _ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr . gardiner .  	63.808201693943744
 i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane one does not often see any body better looking .  	64.22787856524553
 she was at least free from the offence of mr . darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .  	62.46036070071708

 she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .  	64.0264841813494
 she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .  	45.10474579761737

 elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _ her _ coming away .  	74.06125364871595
 " they will join me early to morrow he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr . bingley and his <URL>  	90.45141700957444

 but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .  	57.16227658029216
 when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .  	89.52167722616038

 the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .  	132.476010316866
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .  	44.007516599874975
 it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .  	25.5706757983224

 they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .  	118.6180048568091
 " mr . collins said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited <URL>  	48.359648530337296
 after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr . bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .  	52.441115612302646
 her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . darcy then was .  	53.1147186455051
 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .  	78.69133759469128
 she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .  	59.22435226149975
 " indeed i have , sir was her answer .  	36.750064096875484

 each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr . darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr . bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them .  	41.43025846294412
 " i should like balls infinitely better she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .  	52.42657696090879
 mrs . bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party .  	31.22340214816917
 " what an excellent father you have , girls said she , when the door was shut .  	77.66499214054622
 he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .  	154.81123340451452
 " he is the best landlord , and the best master said she , " that ever lived .  	38.59786963530382
 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr . darcy ' s proposals .  	38.70477083938947
 wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia ' s for him .  	53.248465041383106
 when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .  	66.51657334917036
 " indeed i am .  	14.029166901614804

 this accounted to elizabeth for mr . wickham ' s being among them .  	23.38420713439876
 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .  	54.48507639173198
 bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr . bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .  	35.94319053129978

 i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .  	70.97951585397317

 it was first broken by mrs . annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs . gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .  	78.39295037748462
 smiles decked the face of mrs . bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .  	58.082345875261105

 with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn .  	65.33629478650856
 while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !  	68.72083082246522

 her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .  	82.04221517642762
 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .  	89.52580121017876
 " it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of <URL>  	46.301031185307565

 it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr . darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .  	42.780168454053545
 she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .  	66.04674231506986
 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .  	99.39680361744978
 it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both " then it is , as i always hoped cried jane ; " they are married  	91.35776485664488
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr . collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .  	72.070744572433
 every body is disgusted with his pride .  	43.6373405944793
 mr . bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did <URL>  	68.79321961513395
 i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .  	49.31629385529864
 when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .  	35.27460512383341
 darcy  	168.05601328256614
 " what do you mean , mr . bennet , by talking in this way ?  	24.946498568371748
 wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .  	78.60212678602156
 the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .  	81.55376650417298

 they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs . bennet ' s civilities .  	73.4308522303755
 they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long .  	53.312151368566674
 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing impossible .  	85.61840356734119

 " aye that is because you have the right disposition .  	60.8872989529993
 they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .  	102.98145371221646
 " yes , sir ; but i do not know when _ that _ will be .  	20.479229295123147
 her ladyship was highly incensed .  	40.24354876700528

 after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .  	34.88552804612858

 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr . collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed .  	33.194825468122524

 such very superior dancing is not often seen .  	114.4688977715258

 " i am talking of possibilities , <URL>  	22.084753471241115

 " and of this place thought she , " i might have been mistress !  	43.00083654541485
 mr . darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .  	46.0564085392475
 she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still  	71.40523513539515
 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way .  	106.9548229511845
 elizabeth was now to see mr . wickham for the last time .  	22.173765851033167
 elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .  	51.33728612809705
 <URL>  	17.642663217494775
 mr . collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .  	58.59632973482923
 between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .  	151.2652563872562
 the insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them  	124.96954113436543
 " your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .  	35.46435275870758
 and what do you think she said besides ?  	52.16562143222552
 yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover .  	127.84264626973157
 on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while mrs . jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot stool , that she said , ' mr .  	61.69541406172826

 the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin .  	86.00290948828007
 " indeed , mama , you are mistaken said elizabeth , blushing for her mother .  	26.556707446653267

 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs . gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .  	95.4576649936524
 i told mrs . collins so before you came .  	44.54410317688933

 how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !  	175.5814923061072
 " your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy , " has too much truth .  	68.07369982289167
 as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all mr . collins ' s scruples of leaving mr . and mrs . bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that mr . wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house .  	42.220846978504134

 miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth .  	77.79536877909698
 it was agreed to .  	22.929948050429
 neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .  	96.63533350684195
 there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much .  	60.69519556184311
 on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley .  	84.05619428349408
 miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .  	76.38966172919346
 " he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam .  	81.472120575911

 before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .  	66.56822729666656

 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr . bingley will like it <URL>  	67.73552898956713
 mr . gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs . reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .  	65.80381317763708
 mr . collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs . bennet .  	44.45642832903638
 " i never saw any one so shocked .  	34.02587666465644
 she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .  	71.05683854909068
 she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .  	58.39807191270002
 and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o ' clock .  	65.29815384364659
 " he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .  	34.40418683687711

 he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr . darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .  	64.07354703844658
 " i beg your pardon .  	16.488144560001043
 the housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .  	69.85385543266004
 they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .  	107.33767286527937
 this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to <URL> forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .  	79.78389921855478

 mr . gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror .  	51.05104003877346

 jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .  	72.03037923928017
 to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .  	66.41299787817964

 mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .  	56.066382255630124
 " the first wish of my heart said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them .  	43.344278552029984

 the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .  	57.91847247872013
 elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr . darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .  	46.45078094121829
 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .  	86.84148224655408

 she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .  	87.20916627732522
 mrs . hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr . darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her .  	55.024763641910546

 her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .  	39.60052786152249
 the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .  	65.29591721937145

 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr . darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr . darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .  	59.21855841685526

 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .  	86.99993179751175

 bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .  	64.22922445714106

 they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .  	63.1284739066688

 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr . collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .  	50.64262597452126
 of mr . darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .  	60.40490539828614

 " my dear , dear lizzy , i would i do congratulate you but are you certain ?  	48.03826694494079
 the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ' s drawing room .  	40.880302340117936
 as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .  	73.26717812062174
 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .  	70.77744315351147
 chapter i . elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .  	93.92025262985997

 in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr . darcy , who sat opposite to them .  	41.58231599602366
 but now it was all too natural .  	55.74377435916243

 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street .  	90.39716462487797

 but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr . darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .  	73.43366156034463
 the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation .  	24.426630129734253

 elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _ her had she been his relation .  	68.22825662478581

 mr . collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .  	130.55932706711639

 within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .  	68.66799488869115

 charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .  	47.1872392433848

 when you told mrs . bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else  	92.69859362191916

 bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .  	106.83778495443572
 the possibility of meeting mr . darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .  	40.696132776697915
 she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _ she his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr . darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .  	54.1701470576196
 that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !  	69.62390081001062

 and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .  	58.03143412319411
 he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character .  	60.85527203974327
 mrs . gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .  	36.312338438043675

 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .  	76.59536624793608

 when at length they arose to take leave , mrs . bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr . bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .  	56.482512429855255
 i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .  	54.560403679510024

 elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .  	42.4888936157189
 to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .  	76.16549459686578
 before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs . bennet instantly answered , " oh <URL> am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no <URL> kitty , i want you up <URL>  	60.84864851990542
 [ illustration : morning dress .  	122.19213534697667
 charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .  	74.84355489325112
 bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .  	55.238416667366444

 he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present <URL>  	67.71011636177919

 she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .  	53.88987182348806
 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .  	55.079969078334884
 mrs . gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .  	57.99686542693365
 in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .  	67.98604290364376

 " my dear friend , " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s tête à - tête between two women can never end without a quarrel .  	66.39172148610042
 she was very equal therefore to address mr . bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .  	42.576365151478456
 to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .  	65.34022501217946

 " oh you mean jane , i suppose because he danced with her twice .  	55.45569289623114
 elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr . collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .  	75.91873898806539

 mr . bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .  	63.792085331663245
 darcy said nothing at all .  	40.99294651361624
 at length however mrs . bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .  	40.78260643409281

 but perhaps added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .  	91.8723595603709
 it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions .  	54.84009178301257
 every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch .  	40.489804787224045

 but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .  	42.11610429026521
 elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr . darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr . darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the <URL>  	62.24660987102028

 " i did not know before continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character .  	32.14992687867155
 with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .  	43.84692234414715
 " she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth ; " perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours .  	77.04043714625195
 in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .  	90.71215968323187

 jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected .  	39.67249843580738
 nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .  	207.80552045883843
 all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .  	32.1483949989304
 nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .  	77.63562402227312
 how odious i should think them  	86.9310537824769
 on both sides it was only assertion .  	74.2378200390741

 lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him .  	70.61641520630965
 mr . denny and mr . wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr . philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs . philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .  	40.17981760849028
 _ hunsford , near westerham , kent , 15th <URL> dear sir , the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <URL> mrs .  	88.58159122014732

 your ' s , <URL> mr . darcy ' s letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr . bennet sent to mr . collins , in reply to his last .  	42.96547854908134
 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .  	41.035958405007875
 i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr . darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .  	47.43248918547517

 my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !  	37.090528600195064
 when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .  	70.94823720662313
 mr . wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia .  	65.85202939166331
 she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .  	67.2465154638547

 " and this cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me !  	57.85420261992287
 you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .  	81.71219980595049
 miss bingley was engrossed by mr . darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr . hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .  	53.35924868150444
 his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret .  	67.57492850949421
 " that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance .  	46.19458229320194

 what a contrast between him and his friend !  	88.32628644483908
 mrs . bennet was quite in the fidgets .  	10.812785577790168

 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .  	92.81302559827802

 as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .  	73.31373055029177
 such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .  	51.84638925342027

 this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .  	52.216313387807226

 he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .  	57.84213201976234
 mrs . gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .  	95.20855001064527

 as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .  	65.28108287251905
 " your first position is false .  	34.80763851974211
 the day of his and lydia ' s departure soon came , and mrs . bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .  	58.53078871502939

 as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .  	51.041855981922936

 mrs . hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr . hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .  	80.21062617457584

 they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .  	103.66939861583809

 since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .  	49.619910791616675
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .  	60.012485083622536

 the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .  	70.41281968663031

 and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .  	60.245654986612266

 with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr . darcy afterwards discharged .  	81.6923082092534

 " these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .  	65.48862846934175
 she could think of nothing but of mr . wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr . collins were once silent .  	58.343771319869376
 he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .  	40.527772672185854
 i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte ' s marriage .  	71.71632523259915
 he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .  	66.09038468906374
 it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .  	42.47865882892239
 " well , well said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .  	25.738388856371323
 " i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place  	76.97982288189404
 " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth ; " i am _ not _ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many <URL>  	67.49614336790886
 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .  	74.91976197401506
 " i must go instantly to my mother she cried .  	48.7165182134435
 mr . collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .  	63.09701696535232
 " oh  	14.728720654120439
 when the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .  	77.14658667767299
 every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .  	56.649307045981544
 we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .  	50.68033003292259
 " let me be rightly understood .  	46.236331329522876
 " i never thought mr . darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you used to <URL>  	50.829703985386175
 she cried .  	45.17098814701333
 mr . gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street .  	64.33752475969357
 said she .  	51.83531546797531
 " no .  	14.380528376052737
 their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr . gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days .  	52.27732933075218
 so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !  	69.7177060592381
 " we shall often meet , i hope , in <URL>  	30.9307491755834
 " i advise mr . darcy , and lizzy , and kitty said mrs . bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning .  	28.315205211748438
 she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .  	91.9405856192951
 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .  	89.45100185326595
 she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .  	69.62066274690402
 cried elizabeth , when she had finished .  	25.317521156329406
 after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .  	85.14963746429089
 i was ready to die of laughter .  	31.529654268964585
 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs . forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .  	54.041191254040264
 " i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !  	41.18200216708404
 * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs . bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived .  	51.37376737312998
 my dear father she cried , " come back , and write immediately .  	60.50338104384198
 there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .  	84.353165268536
 miss bingley ' s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the <URL> took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .  	62.09607325746139

 i _ must _ have employment and society .  	60.92648964821389
 i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by <URL> are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to <URL>  	63.71464163233974
 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .  	54.80952655494109
 after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ?  	108.73461229972025
 elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative .  	60.655684676560526
 you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .  	106.44385247917263
 mr . bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !  	55.057000200930965
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .  	98.15800968020234
 the possibility of mr . collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr . collins !  	54.21715082100786
 " oh !  	3.6456621817053128
 cried elizabeth ; " but how could _ that _ be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress  	116.55336755974476
 neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .  	124.15412698223707
 she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza !  	53.940203695349936

 not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive .  	74.10938433996563
 not that i mean to find fault with _ you for such things i know are all chance in this world .  	98.93480328216681
 an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .  	34.2738108414215
 " that is <URL> could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .  	59.45145733780965

 darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .  	35.91727888661882
 it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well .  	89.84092843311257
 he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .  	60.16277985405385
 but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .  	71.56322934572096
 but why mr . darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .  	41.80146096138905
 _ he _ was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ' s letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .  	80.09969724700673
 her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr . darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too _ little she might have fancied too _ much  	68.7392406549026
 she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .  	56.12707118955843
 it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect <URL>  	96.64984766169191
 they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .  	34.157741674189424
 " i am sure _ i _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .  	69.75779794313115
 its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs . bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .  	66.05927219292599
 having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so .  	126.88869934675955
 had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference , and _ your _ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !  	92.09428434230128
 he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .  	42.77275806530307
 mr . darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .  	39.350100831974224
 the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .  	44.78904979886485
 she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .  	97.39472713604667
 you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage .  	106.63266398556259
 her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .  	78.24668551934992
 the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr . collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you  	62.392312577296266
 how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .  	133.98865353712839
 she enquired after his sister , but could do no more .  	34.88876104778459
 charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .  	77.94942338383743
 first of all , he asked miss lucas .  	59.208998091129914

 he had been some time with mr . gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .  	52.386555106530324
 i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .  	42.68355313659514
 after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr . bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .  	70.46377567957433
 indeed he has no improper pride .  	65.65731983215551
 his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .  	55.18308190993035
 but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .  	57.7164008225604
 you supposed more than really existed .  	114.36550765851584
 mrs . bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .  	73.73152642493008
 his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .  	66.65932288084753
 to know that her daughter would be married was enough .  	36.861367738595725
 i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may <URL>  	44.21734562800968
 i am not at all afraid of her dying .  	36.25958044521605
 but these are not jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design .  	50.61545308106852
 he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .  	75.09946922587372
 this was agreed to , and mrs . philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .  	64.5790290215924
 she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .  	65.57719091843012
 elizabeth replied that it was .  	27.254694872700462

 mary and kitty were both with mrs . bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .  	76.16863483677433
 as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .  	78.95100586074578

 lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .  	80.38822983286485
 she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .  	79.6893338813737
 my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .  	128.90401795333
 they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr . gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr . bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .  	61.00382455392481
 " oh , yes that , that is the worst of all .  	26.357191810183703

 had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?  	124.88895833670769
 cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .  	34.36456827046577
 she had very little notice from any but him .  	73.29914654232995
 my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can ' t write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me .  	36.98254960164668
 through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .  	104.8416134281574
 there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .  	86.28475376993379
 when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .  	95.2073488182347

 <URL>  	17.642663217494775
 in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .  	56.42602922438971

 his disposition must be <URL>  	30.331883685594534
 i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any <URL>  	127.02379777104963

 miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present .  	63.55782627899609
 there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .  	42.79852424728966
 mr . darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .  	36.81917585904783
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .  	83.74631322004858
 have you seen any pleasant men ?  	104.04600042871164
 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .  	47.13037955831969
 people _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .  	47.15534142479084
 when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .  	38.88479970963241
 when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .  	45.79277802563512
 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .  	66.7898275043647
 in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?  	171.4052092845824
 " do you certainly leave kent on saturday  	122.1542787719675

 " his pride said miss lucas , " does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .  	55.713341789196214
 but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .  	124.14602716783992

 his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr . collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .  	66.03946123763289
 cried mrs . bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr . darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !  	58.16305762349525
 " yes , very indifferent indeed said elizabeth , laughingly .  	40.368652655038

 if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .  	55.308467864498894
 mr . bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .  	42.55031354497845
 colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs . collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .  	76.35813629732179

 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .  	74.46297323615218

 as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the <URL> park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr . collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .  	65.1257385755293

 when mr . collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .  	62.639057563365476
 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr . collins instead !  	125.9801406069535

 never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .  	91.1560964113544

 though lydia ' s short letter to mrs . f . gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w . never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f . who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b . intending to trace their route .  	117.01798407073947

 very few days passed in which mr . collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .  	62.94747404083811
 and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .  	37.74331652972653

 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart .  	117.50011393976249
 he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr . darcy .  	76.31241091945196

 mr . collins made his declaration in form .  	35.65555266498657
 my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr . wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .  	84.33623085223084
 consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr . bingley in consequence of it , before _ they _ did .  	51.90102762171859

 what could be more natural than his asking you again ?  	65.07505744828707
 how is such a man to be worked on ?  	48.09310909989993
 to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .  	78.26413840524259
 lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone .  	79.60698918718862

 mrs . bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .  	53.511753535040036
 she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .  	142.67840666818392

 she replied in the affirmative .  	27.03868558603917
 his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .  	79.64222668753355
 the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .  	68.38982950994833
 more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .  	149.1813985034811
 lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr . collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .  	81.24258985539726

 mr . collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .  	35.88792650698463
 having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .  	69.75946508970554
 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr . wickham .  	51.4270054711979
 she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr . wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented .  	55.764987002752015

 elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr . darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .  	71.10071370530308
 on finding mrs . bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning  	69.76665386680644

 mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs . bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone .  	53.70829143874358
 and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .  	48.22981682119942

 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs . bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .  	114.54576657789865

 he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .  	62.78670902593778
 these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .  	156.04033015490722

 his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .  	67.69555345836089
 but that is nothing to us .  	29.65954508393097
 the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful .  	47.53037510016521
 lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .  	69.42274928588505
 now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .  	86.73719836569482
 " but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .  	82.85304866020171

 it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .  	59.66539745191209

 mrs . bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr . bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .  	64.534948843316

 mr . collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .  	74.92246533404645

 elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .  	56.61134559712221
 such a disappointment !  	68.76490972363558

 mr . wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .  	63.02616161780863
 lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs . bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs . bennet ' s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .  	67.95302320253913

 with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful and " charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .  	74.24942266146587

 " from what we have seen of him continued mrs . gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .  	49.93910665525391
 and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .  	96.86363299382815
 mr . wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .  	83.34243273906779
 " because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .  	78.20351700471474
 after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer .  	79.14286545895739

 he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .  	82.42356090814415

 not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you .  	57.38943598788394
 my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .  	35.77960920573813
 elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .  	43.62742680395056
 it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .  	50.13332625932476
 elizabeth read on ; " i have seen them both .  	52.09785215757677

 mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .  	135.63017562450648
 " lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do <URL>  	35.7552781504346
 but with _ me it is not so .  	31.153089261338707
 elizabeth longed to observe that mr . bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .  	50.7114145005879
 poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .  	65.15293387133119
 the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious .  	57.228941420927484
 elizabeth looked surprised .  	27.00375564386303
 " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .  	52.45859065661221
 what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?  	89.57299408016988
 he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .  	38.59179845608448
 the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .  	58.36135376003837
 and then when we came away it was such fun !  	86.3046233080066
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him  	99.09330111419592
 what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !  	91.00576823165288
 jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .  	108.302626360683
 and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr . darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of <URL> entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a <URL>  	51.31591348538152

 but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came .  	75.7902532243349

 but mrs . bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .  	51.45682351784452
 was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .  	52.003653012887774
 the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine .  	84.09120266482152

 mrs . bennet was really in a most pitiable state .  	22.274451166965267
 elizabeth made no answer .  	21.08080550135345
 i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .  	70.26653778025414
 she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .  	74.60940071339584

 " complied with !  	98.63821252062355
 what an agreeable man sir william is , mr . bingley is not he ?  	46.88837889287864

 " nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination said elizabeth .  	45.77676697939708
 elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .  	58.079760930927655
 they agreed that mrs . bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .  	60.49308748483289
 " oh  	14.728720654120439

 on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .  	111.64799820442856
 but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .  	87.02737971442798
 that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr . bingley , was incomprehensible .  	73.10586481688405
 but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you .  	43.97206045174067
 when they repaired to the dining room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .  	42.439593018628706
 he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .  	98.54257485114994
 elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .  	60.120227954103306
 " yes the late mr . darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .  	35.52228195762848

 after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled .  	75.53527181982976
 mr . bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .  	45.96551301780118
 her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .  	102.56507901778528
 " he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling .  	45.953504417575466
 her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .  	57.15643820607225

 mr . darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .  	25.34243990243873
 the visit was returned in due form .  	59.24207970859327

 colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs . collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .  	64.59175942193492
 " i cannot believe it .  	12.34774155918452

 again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .  	52.61995333704116
 she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .  	73.43562294425948
 in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .  	32.320789915751114

 lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance .  	57.06288215005612

 the idea of mr . collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .  	94.55273178576759
 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .  	60.675375275777654

 it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr . darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .  	74.2787065468892
 she was overpowered by shame and vexation .  	28.867487912976205

 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .  	71.96367481056178

 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family .  	81.20040391668839
 at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .  	40.08320569081602

 but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .  	72.63930408461079
 she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .  	71.15590070238066

 after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .  	101.09546647989387

 a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr . darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .  	72.48440036609874
 the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .  	50.7311770014991
 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .  	61.19406399818226

 when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr . bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .  	55.91743689349171
 " mr . darcy is not to be laughed at  	40.9546276245307

 in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?  	94.03675632763493
 let me never see either one or the other again  	251.73488939578982
 said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied <URL>  	38.56991780676087

 however little mr . darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .  	83.5126732752609

 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .  	85.4961107952262
 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .  	75.30164128347529

 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .  	61.21370542996617
 " and then said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .  	91.57268375356635

 the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr . wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .  	51.948144098237655
 i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .  	68.24030442461918
 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .  	51.87319792423917
 had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .  	68.5111287280112
 but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .  	71.75719142891252

 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _ him  	91.28655136132102
 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr . darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !  	71.38163958569591
 as for their mother , mr . collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .  	45.464238684048595
 had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .  	89.45988370450173

 when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr . darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .  	51.434459373170164

 elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .  	41.72146856134353
 dear , yes but you must own she is very plain .  	124.77625121952377
 his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs . hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .  	65.44417464261886

 she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .  	58.801366281330736
 in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs . gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .  	56.67436598518642
 as for jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .  	56.675935509607996

 but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .  	99.11435770673401

 a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr . bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and mrs . bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .  	50.97479549516153

 " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .  	83.6119140853696

 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr . bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .  	44.404510204612585
 " my object _ then replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .  	61.053947502830034

 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs . bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .  	57.00803218512209
 and his answering immediately to the last question oh !  	137.0599412027143

 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration .  	36.508723576223005
 whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .  	54.09057555050689
