 he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .  	131.1832778547675
 said jane .  	31.68146138235568
 it is just as he chooses .  	33.55289677056903
 " this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter said elizabeth .  	93.60871171010554
 who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival  	351.95946396471373
 there was another reason too for her opposition .  	113.38696552079557
 yours ever , " caroline <URL>  	304.4960547493383
 " you allude perhaps to the entail of this <URL>  	34.25357799379538
 " i certainly shall not .  	20.205738051896837
 mr . bennet ' s expectations were fully answered .  	53.135150104783946
 darcy you see , is the man !  	111.21994246306427
 yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long .  	152.68778515592444
 mr . wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which mr . darcy just deigned to return .  	148.7689100003342
 teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !  	817.6378822412187
 " why will you think so ?  	33.85892317685064
 when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .  	113.35845048747579
 i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my <URL>  	82.04500811057665
 elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion .  	123.45899563192337
 i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .  	36.15598640395376
 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr . collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings .  	170.2239369958705
 " you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin .  	108.90631057559332
 since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _ his _ design .  	111.70637498652759
 chapter xix .  	14.092063071617677
 " but why all this secrecy ?  	112.85427920065449
 from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .  	140.71469997453258
 " i should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered <URL>  	106.01187932496244
 " not at all he replied ; " they were brightened by the <URL>  	38.95393502806933
 i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .  	216.99615419058972
 i ought not to have said a word about it .  	32.66636114976812
 " yes , ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as affable to the <URL>  	45.11506939858835
 mr . darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .  	44.28938626734493
 his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .  	105.34423331820645
 but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .  	66.79854346006724
 it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .  	162.45102560665237
 she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .  	53.228567053703195
 elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .  	130.11047800970823
 oh !  	9.594876611161258
 " my dear , dear aunt she rapturously cried , " what delight !  	87.48565317837428
 she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr . darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .  	56.10032247711581
 but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and _ that _ in the eye of a servant comprehends every <URL>  	51.315776846101066
 i hope we may often meet <URL>  	62.70519521896191
 elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .  	75.08460843949437
 she says lizzy had better have taken mr . collins ; but _ i _ do not think there would have been any fun in it .  	51.82304251527534
 then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of <URL>  	202.58350739618695
 but we are all liable to error .  	56.81923857156361
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion .  	222.9548905354904
 no it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by mr . darcy .  	42.01492302437797
 " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse said mr . bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .  	62.04384577042803
 " no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you <URL>  	40.18868149279498
 secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .  	202.3921137681942
 " it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she .  	80.71574783606546
 the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as <URL> you draw  	212.9458125937333
 it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes <URL>  	228.39502642983655
 she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .  	65.6372006189816
 cried elizabeth .  	24.06685855156221
 oh !  	9.594876611161258
 for , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .  	231.50642842871972
 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .  	87.05620268808227
 to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .  	198.1813616003228
 end of the second volume .  	63.79905941570836
 " it was the prospect of constant society , and good society he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire .  	188.949493738442
 jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .  	147.5482739788053
 before any answer could arrive from mr . collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .  	195.9188133368756
 in spite of having been at st . james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .  	135.01446552126532
 had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _ with _ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .  	93.0602346358834
 but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs . bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .  	99.74231425038738
 she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr . darcy , she moved again towards the gate .  	59.36694025975927
 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .  	75.15426141604826
 lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .  	135.29188081333706
 " i have no right to give _ my _ opinion said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise .  	40.75299358163873
 to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .  	98.5250138291199
 lord bless me !  	1287.8469089436205
 " oh !  	3.6456621817053128
 he arranges the business just as he <URL>  	124.36246240257812
 we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .  	64.43981432408681
 " and what did she say  	59.42049936677338
 " if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr . gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .  	59.3963166139274
 " in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .  	71.2847099021093
 it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .  	118.29313389898876
 yes i understand you <URL>  	66.43742334244055
 dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .  	65.87287281429869
 elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .  	102.69799969394714
 how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !  	201.6838645450821
 darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .  	58.87143831916286
 " as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very <URL>  	63.79344019295122
 from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .  	126.15884263866839
 he replied , and was again silent .  	45.06221620320546
 for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr . darcy ' s , but you shall do as you <URL>  	25.985192771291768

 " my dearest child she cried , " i can think of nothing else !  	53.87115021424935
 but mrs . bennet , was not so well pleased with it .  	23.10214940025633
 they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him .  	53.31814635233634
 her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .  	49.607533428390056
 " miss eliza bennet said miss bingley , " despises cards .  	54.863659931714764
 but she would not be secure .  	31.104909442304724
 mr . gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .  	77.04005136339228
 " i have heard much of your master ' s fine person said mrs . gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face .  	43.14952891254559
 but if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs . long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on <URL>  	127.32963266095727

 " and yours he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand <URL>  	125.79897664029049
 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .  	82.42799751389275
 bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .  	52.63920107338012
 you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your <URL>  	164.90816805528817
 she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .  	87.29222096940504
 elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr . darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?  	59.158209899871366

 " very <URL>  	20.01664897123825
 mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no <URL> of the party were now applied to .  	130.9781979746878
 it is unaccountable !  	48.15997824706673
 he danced only four dances !  	120.6071362736844
 lizzy declares she will not have mr . collins , and mr . collins begins to say that he will not have <URL>  	28.17386618756752
 it would be dreadful !  	67.35840010668358
 as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of .  	159.3518143954573
 but gracious me !  	403.84101080844187
 " there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .  	208.59725623155364
 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .  	109.60082983027179
 it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .  	160.67212354931274
 nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .  	106.4280495166737
 elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .  	56.2755400157349
 jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .  	214.56245916978855
 jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .  	38.17469689828845
 my temper i dare not vouch <URL> is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world .  	224.49863828703891
 but my dear lydia , i don ' t at all like your going such a way off .  	78.59093516565379
 " she did indeed , louisa .  	61.162278254070415
 she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .  	161.92276307033995
 but here he was set right by mrs . bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .  	45.55637981391995
 it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs . philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .  	91.75674560237069

 lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .  	43.42164156674819
 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my <URL>  	103.45306246696363

 but are you pleased , jane ?  	79.19284200102949
 he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .  	209.43708372994212
 i believe him to be lady catherine ' s _ nephew  	61.86818170548395
 the hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs . bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .  	159.4938936588931
 and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a <URL>  	124.0026812685039
 wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say , three very silly sisters .  	183.40897689667136
 the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept <URL>  	78.26121106633994

 there is no danger of wickham ' s marrying mary king .  	51.54591007581947
 painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .  	202.14918207254846
 but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other <URL>  	309.4731068386664
 repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .  	165.3810375839844
 miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .  	142.67674432685246
 never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .  	296.0584506431434
 when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .  	86.61397944316808
 my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .  	132.56981078209878
 how acutely did she now feel it .  	391.2358840961488
 " and have you answered the letter  	78.31116956938747
 " not as you represent it .  	61.032144999714454
 the discussion of mr . collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .  	184.2319082086566
 it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .  	111.2435598093062
 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .  	74.14739502882861
 you wanted me , i know , to say ' yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .  	102.03224129070466
 " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak <URL> advantage can it be to you to offend mr .  	207.97525881809577
 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .  	102.14297476384998
 as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .  	162.5523295782229
 as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was .  	51.428990663299224
 but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is .  	59.24847286766058
 he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .  	85.75559251086464
 it was all <URL>  	21.52599714775067
 he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .  	115.42010894023348
 it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .  	114.73722176692787
 a lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .  	153.5409892060517
 at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .  	103.31698334924972
 i hope they will not meet at all .  	29.62181856674341
 " but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere  	196.95213808664622
 without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .  	155.06141368297534
 perhaps _ she _ is full young to be much in company .  	87.59215916711182
 good girl !  	92.6235852719619
 it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _ when _ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . darcy !  	110.74176119344126
 elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ?  	103.2875898902773
 " nay cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .  	98.51836684132368

 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .  	182.69787037374454
 _ my _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr . philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr . darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property .  	110.02616676629019
 allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place .  	144.93669565712142
 the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs . forster , the delight of mrs . bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .  	70.24107789907043
 at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr . darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .  	131.23434139776086
 the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end  	2820.1375137285613
 she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .  	132.46303181504317

 send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .  	304.51836614670003
 such were the gentle murmurs of mrs . bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr . bingley ' s continued absence .  	62.951144434806274
 why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?  	271.3466762991359

 miss bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .  	34.09263430717491
 " indeed replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .  	99.39947215634135
 it is every way horrible  	133.25510717999384
 " i know little of the game , at present said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life mrs . philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .  	61.534743357623746

 after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me .  	56.27233273175746

 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .  	111.862078000665
 cried he , turning towards her .  	59.968208440448116

 elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .  	207.1065345991097

 at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr . darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .  	154.246040232834

 " mrs . annesley is with her .  	32.46563363150882
 sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .  	111.25229118922537
 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .  	89.66267646818748
 presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .  	150.30297955878598
 it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or <URL>  	341.6801247255507

 they met again on sunday , and then _ i _ saw him too .  	55.15383762076481
 elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that  	108.74097689574363
 it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days <URL>  	154.7458443783435
 he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .  	80.43528294031147
 his words seemed to imply it .  	39.335155123829125
 his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .  	58.05204072255599
 wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right .  	181.2755855445817
 she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .  	61.1226140824904
 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .  	81.35434808142799
 they were , therefore , to <URL> was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .  	59.78217743040247

 _ her _ mind was less difficult to develope .  	73.83608961741643
 perhaps he thought her too young .  	86.97496141065781
 but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .  	59.598045854676656
 elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr . wickham and herself .  	53.23879674700778
 when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .  	134.94194953467056
 tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day .  	96.45609334399947
 did she call to refuse her consent  	336.916983074557

 if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !  	102.8247398866551
 but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .  	107.7486137382886
 " already arisen  	5065.812738918236

 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years <URL>  	114.44910771382442
 her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .  	84.95613392881818

 " let me first see how he behaves said she ; " it will then be early enough for <URL>  	123.08348309658915

 his acquaintance with elizabeth was very <URL>  	72.98115825796492
 but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .  	333.80095011084114

 her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr . gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .  	80.4773184652394
 this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .  	104.12134645358206
 perhaps i am not doing her justice .  	57.34000287970894
 elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .  	182.40119623805958
 her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said .  	117.23829699694453
 " you are a good girl he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .  	37.781256588432335
 in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .  	135.48137497951183
 it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .  	33.39399909370135
 " no , she would go home .  	29.893753967357913
 lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .  	47.987138138695045
 wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .  	94.03593582501384
 mr . darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth <URL>  	41.13839076711975
 but your _ family _ owe me nothing .  	87.88352618088652
 much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married .  	115.30984393505378
 with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .  	235.49005618510253
 said <URL> certainly saw mr . darcy speaking to <URL>  	116.55280776672046
 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .  	174.99971456507205
 next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .  	380.35372254294964
 said miss bingley ; " will she be as tall as i am  	101.62698109756381

 jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ?  	122.16828284702412
 repeated miss bingley .  	40.29392301336453
 at present i will say nothing about <URL>  	67.58528638615627

 mrs . collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .  	104.56285579132847
 in ran mrs . bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .  	250.84799270340963
 " you have a house in town , i conclude  	40.496121034340625

 elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room .  	60.01275818467463
 he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .  	96.74579675947246

 " not at all was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about <URL>  	82.75644828599242

 " while i can have my mornings to myself said she , " it is <URL> think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .  	203.13615523205868

 it originated in mrs . gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s .  	143.14979166169812
 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .  	92.72458226766219
 he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .  	109.2369980182497
 all field sports were over .  	191.99003015169274
 they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to .  	219.00404370194198
 it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .  	76.62580995390418
 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _ she _ been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .  	121.30346919879923
 not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .  	97.2965813721728
 elizabeth immediately began playing again .  	175.35857020026958
 mr . hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .  	94.91457669457402
 of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance !  	173.15097523702008
 as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr . bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day  	139.48199412621264

 why was he to be the judge  	151.67804921029884
 but however he did not .  	44.012411913028316
 elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .  	202.005935928292
 mrs . bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .  	86.62874156243457
 i hardly know how mr . collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her <URL>  	48.437193703326095
 " to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart .  	89.6085899093519
 elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .  	91.33182982724952
 my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherine .  	68.5503533582073

 " i honour your circumspection .  	284.88580035565354
 " undoubtedly replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .  	181.66009799736304
 as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .  	71.51030663127906
 our situation with regard to lady catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .  	306.1146261416364
 mr . darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .  	81.79531218892494
 * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs . bennet ' s curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .  	62.408934217560606
 she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .  	215.91334454402823
 thank god !  	1807.8251811783039
 how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !  	138.62455928836
 mr . bingley followed his advice .  	19.35517572218556
 mrs . hill began instantly to express her joy .  	86.40783834513125
 elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .  	68.41032994032456
 a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .  	315.1560088623919
 on their being joined by mr . bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .  	99.08247073725857

 there was no want of discourse .  	38.22470080476701

 " my dearest sister , now _ be _ be serious .  	81.18018578320188
 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .  	197.17690444523961
 their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .  	385.9597090790468
 a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self importance and humility .  	87.32023089660886

 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr . darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .  	206.89787068030506
