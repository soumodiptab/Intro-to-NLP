<BEGIN> the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse . <END>	4.378843196242827
<BEGIN> an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs . bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . <END>	4.599791021939556
<BEGIN> mr . bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . mrs . bennet was quite disconcerted . <END>	5.9283607454152225
<BEGIN> she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be . <END>	4.92482088856637
<BEGIN> lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . <END>	4.904446178207709
<BEGIN> the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . <END>	4.268988948800608
<BEGIN> and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; mr . bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . <END>	4.0579731599166955

<BEGIN> his brother in - law , mr . hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . <END>	4.865837802629036
<BEGIN> the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . <END>	4.192909655750542

<BEGIN> amongst the most violent against him was mrs . bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . <END>	4.4856606321667005
<BEGIN> elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . <END>	4.604934621429229

<BEGIN> her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . <END>	6.226208346105399

<BEGIN> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr . wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . <END>	4.195915767991079

<BEGIN> in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . <END>	4.391536589602396

<BEGIN> they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it . <END>	4.214597022056621

<BEGIN> he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . <END>	4.1783941469696035
<BEGIN> such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . <END>	4.36051120217193

<BEGIN> it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . <END>	4.871864658044694

<BEGIN> georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . <END>	4.035694566730032
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . <END>	4.9104044484624625

<BEGIN> the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs . annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . <END>	4.3636284354716235
<BEGIN> while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr . darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . <END>	4.774723106974395
<BEGIN> in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr . darcy were by no means over . <END>	5.193334850193234
<BEGIN> miss darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . <END>	5.052252621479701

<BEGIN> while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . <END>	4.079244559896856
<BEGIN> had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . <END>	4.558824191689231

<BEGIN> don ' t think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . <END>	6.590635822854473
<BEGIN> if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . <END>	4.893159422412231
<BEGIN> your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . <END>	4.899658456884038
<BEGIN> but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit . <END>	5.381841025930096
<BEGIN> mr . darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . <END>	5.764708284060008
<BEGIN> it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ your ' s _ seems to have been . <END>	5.00454786925441
<BEGIN> he came to tell mr . gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr . wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once . <END>	6.777332926876622
<BEGIN> from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . <END>	4.158485525311397
<BEGIN> the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him . <END>	4.734587389409539
<BEGIN> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . <END>	4.4761998608399365
<BEGIN> his character was to speak for itself . <END>	5.417504728408264
<BEGIN> he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . <END>	4.697185363644694
<BEGIN> if he _ had another _ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . <END>	5.720312389058418
<BEGIN> he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . <END>	5.655597141021075
<BEGIN> there is a lady , it seems , a mrs . younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . <END>	5.776573679991557
<BEGIN> this mrs . younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . <END>	5.820117074922715
<BEGIN> but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . <END>	6.329284307353029
<BEGIN> she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . <END>	5.119789859011273
<BEGIN> wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . <END>	5.622366458800464
<BEGIN> at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction . <END>	5.1107476254858755
<BEGIN> they were in street . <END>	7.995982923790671
<BEGIN> he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia . <END>	7.1875086464687135
<BEGIN> but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . <END>	4.907928060242955
<BEGIN> she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham . <END>	5.072234789292566
<BEGIN> she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . <END>	6.556770809506299
<BEGIN> since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _ his _ design . <END>	4.758721372566789
<BEGIN> he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . <END>	4.46084832755666
<BEGIN> he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . <END>	5.083315987376117
<BEGIN> though mr . bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . <END>	7.8776968418083415
<BEGIN> but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . <END>	4.073129110534393
<BEGIN> under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . <END>	6.861064849343853
<BEGIN> they met several times , for there was much to be discussed . <END>	6.284872042136046
<BEGIN> wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . <END>	5.827789136432942
<BEGIN> every thing being settled between _ them mr . darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home . <END>	5.491969957624594
<BEGIN> but mr . gardiner could not be seen , and mr . darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . <END>	5.8496726901288465
<BEGIN> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former . <END>	4.386186249856824
<BEGIN> he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . <END>	5.718873835485524
<BEGIN> on saturday he came again . <END>	7.92033207982602
<BEGIN> your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . <END>	5.9836536809409395
<BEGIN> it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . <END>	4.685843324321711
<BEGIN> but our visitor was very obstinate . <END>	6.868113634201266
<BEGIN> i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . <END>	5.097161550580024
<BEGIN> they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . <END>	4.956220861152348
<BEGIN> but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . <END>	4.08006936664646
<BEGIN> but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most . <END>	4.830844330055779
<BEGIN> you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . <END>	5.898994813748173
<BEGIN> his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her and his commission purchased . <END>	4.074683284605829
<BEGIN> the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . <END>	6.023480195772511
<BEGIN> it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . <END>	5.32911598214548
<BEGIN> perhaps there was some truth in _ this though i doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody ' s _ reserve , can be answerable for the event . <END>	5.20715622611302
<BEGIN> but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair . <END>	4.605612090620788
<BEGIN> i believe i have now told you every thing . <END>	6.1736153179090545
<BEGIN> it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . <END>	4.9801628260461355
<BEGIN> lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house . <END>	4.954671272743063
<BEGIN> i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . <END>	5.139115260094993
<BEGIN> if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen . <END>	6.956059705953919
<BEGIN> i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . <END>	4.868358386391538
<BEGIN> mr . darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding . <END>	4.827774634918349
<BEGIN> he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday . <END>	5.750373656079129
<BEGIN> will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him . <END>	4.892455979344167
<BEGIN> his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . <END>	4.849029691133599
<BEGIN> his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that if he marry _ prudently his wife may teach him . <END>	4.666608560936562
<BEGIN> i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name . <END>	5.2873777630524375
<BEGIN> but slyness seems the fashion . <END>	6.67308654486195
<BEGIN> but i must write no more . <END>	5.9662176336559725
<BEGIN> the children have been wanting me this half hour . <END>	6.815164440275977
<BEGIN> your ' s , very sincerely , " m . <END>	5.261144362673269
<BEGIN> the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . <END>	5.350618424417504
<BEGIN> he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . <END>	3.790915600260086
<BEGIN> he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . <END>	5.839584407228073
<BEGIN> her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . <END>	6.640587362868436
<BEGIN> but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . <END>	4.6124546396881945
<BEGIN> he had to be sure done much . <END>	7.7537622972944495
<BEGIN> she was ashamed to think how much . <END>	6.408393905328942
<BEGIN> but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief . <END>	4.915334217371953
<BEGIN> it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . <END>	4.681430353878373

<BEGIN> oh ! <END>	7.868804568635358
<BEGIN> how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him . <END>	4.581459143147048
<BEGIN> for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . <END>	6.196808888985119

<BEGIN> it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . <END>	7.896961190376063
<BEGIN> she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr . darcy and herself . <END>	4.194681011149631
