<BEGIN> he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father . <END>	2.2353526744330146
<BEGIN> the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse . <END>	1.845852657190421
<BEGIN> an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs . bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . <END>	1.754555853013594
<BEGIN> mr . bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . mrs . bennet was quite disconcerted . <END>	2.798337798577163
<BEGIN> she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be . <END>	2.0716773060677296
<BEGIN> lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . <END>	2.0683370015603737
<BEGIN> the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . <END>	1.6405407577544413

<BEGIN> his brother in - law , mr . hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . <END>	2.0727357969449263
<BEGIN> the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . <END>	1.761544688111257

<BEGIN> amongst the most violent against him was mrs . bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters . <END>	1.9016837488698712
<BEGIN> elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it . <END>	2.1004844715018023

<BEGIN> nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . <END>	1.856313928701592

<BEGIN> never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . <END>	1.4941202954419113

<BEGIN> she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it . <END>	2.5280527341713435
<BEGIN> they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . <END>	1.9531047609207473
<BEGIN> her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . darcy then was . <END>	2.114659148496985

<BEGIN> at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . <END>	2.1341105444665027
<BEGIN> they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . <END>	1.6540204409118027
<BEGIN> mr . gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . <END>	2.2575250266724174
<BEGIN> with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . <END>	2.764072689471579
<BEGIN> it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts . <END>	1.9438929062210586
<BEGIN> they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it . <END>	1.7085203694336113
<BEGIN> elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . <END>	2.1611022658530112
<BEGIN> her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr . gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . <END>	2.0764580512687045
<BEGIN> whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . <END>	3.091191920630081
<BEGIN> elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . <END>	1.9865607384458739

<BEGIN> that he was _ surprised _ by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr . gardiner . <END>	2.060875721520866
<BEGIN> elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . <END>	3.2630246920252484

<BEGIN> she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . <END>	1.8344686931986927
<BEGIN> the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr . darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . <END>	2.0073347305002227

<BEGIN> they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . <END>	2.059157261361651
<BEGIN> but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . <END>	1.801764359223061

<BEGIN> the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above . <END>	2.6515090023499943

<BEGIN> perhaps there was some truth in _ this though i doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody ' s _ reserve , can be answerable for the event . <END>	1.9380778331567772
<BEGIN> but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair . <END>	2.090991338294517

<BEGIN> his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . <END>	2.040123918572358
