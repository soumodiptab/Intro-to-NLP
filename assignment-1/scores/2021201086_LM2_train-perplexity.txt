<BEGIN> the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr . bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . <END> :: 1.3949078932556698
