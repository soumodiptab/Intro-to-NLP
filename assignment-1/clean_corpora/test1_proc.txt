<BEGIN>  <END>
<BEGIN> however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his <END>
<BEGIN> first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds <END>
<BEGIN> of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful <END>
<BEGIN> property of some one or other of their daughters . <END>
