<BEGIN> a yellow dressinggown , ungirdled , was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air . <END>
<BEGIN> he held the bowl aloft and intoned : — _ introibo ad altare dei <END>
<BEGIN> halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely : —come up , kinch ! <END>
<BEGIN> come up , you fearful jesuit ! <END>
<BEGIN> solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest . <END>
<BEGIN> he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower , the surrounding land and the awaking mountains . <END>
<BEGIN> then , catching sight of stephen dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly . <END>
<BEGIN> —back to barracks ! <END>
<BEGIN> he said sternly . <END>
<BEGIN> he added in a preacher’s tone : —for this , o dearly beloved , is the genuine christine : body and soul and blood and ouns . <END>
<BEGIN> slow music , please . <END>
<BEGIN> shut your eyes , gents . <END>
<BEGIN> one moment . <END>
<BEGIN> a little trouble about those white corpuscles . <END>
<BEGIN> silence , all . <END>
<BEGIN> he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points . <END>
<BEGIN> chrysostomos . <END>
<BEGIN> two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm . <END>
<BEGIN> —thanks , old chap , he cried briskly . <END>
<BEGIN> that will do nicely . <END>
<BEGIN> switch off the current , will you ? <END>
<BEGIN> he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher , gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown . <END>
<BEGIN> the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages . <END>
<BEGIN> a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips . <END>
<BEGIN> —the mockery of it ! <END>
<BEGIN> he said gaily . <END>
<BEGIN> your absurd name , an ancient greek ! <END>
<BEGIN> he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan’s gay voice went on . <END>
<BEGIN> —my name is absurd too : malachi mulligan , two dactyls . <END>
<BEGIN> but it has a hellenic ring , hasn’t it ? <END>
<BEGIN> tripping and sunny like the buck himself . <END>
<BEGIN> we must go to athens . <END>
<BEGIN> will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ? <END>
<BEGIN> he laid the brush aside and , laughing with delight , cried : —will he come ? <END>
<BEGIN> the jejune jesuit ! <END>
<BEGIN> ceasing , he began to shave with care . <END>
<BEGIN> —tell me , mulligan , stephen said quietly . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , my love ? <END>
<BEGIN> —how long is haines going to stay in this tower ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder . <END>
<BEGIN> —god , isn’t he dreadful ? <END>
<BEGIN> he said frankly . <END>
<BEGIN> a ponderous saxon . <END>
<BEGIN> he thinks you’re not a gentleman . <END>
<BEGIN> god , these bloody english ! <END>
<BEGIN> bursting with money and indigestion . <END>
<BEGIN> because he comes from oxford . <END>
<BEGIN> you know , dedalus , you have the real oxford manner . <END>
<BEGIN> he can’t make you out . <END>
<BEGIN> o , my name for you is the best : kinch , the knife blade . <END>
<BEGIN> he shaved warily over his chin . <END>
<BEGIN> —he was raving all night about a black panther , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> where is his guncase ? <END>
<BEGIN> —a woful lunatic ! <END>
<BEGIN> mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> were you in a funk ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i was , stephen said with energy and growing fear . <END>
<BEGIN> out here in the dark with a man i don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther . <END>
<BEGIN> you saved men from drowning . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m not a hero , however . <END>
<BEGIN> if he stays on here i am off . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade . <END>
<BEGIN> he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily . <END>
<BEGIN> —scutter ! <END>
<BEGIN> he cried thickly . <END>
<BEGIN> he came over to the gunrest and , thrusting a hand into stephen’s upper pocket , said : —lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly . <END>
<BEGIN> then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : —the bard’s noserag ! <END>
<BEGIN> a new art colour for our irish poets : snotgreen . <END>
<BEGIN> you can almost taste it , can’t you ? <END>
<BEGIN> he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly . <END>
<BEGIN> —god ! <END>
<BEGIN> he said quietly . <END>
<BEGIN> isn’t the sea what algy calls it : a great sweet mother ? <END>
<BEGIN> the snotgreen sea . <END>
<BEGIN> the scrotumtightening sea . <END>
<BEGIN> _ epi oinopa ponton <END>
<BEGIN> ah , dedalus , the greeks ! <END>
<BEGIN> i must teach you . <END>
<BEGIN> you must read them in the original . <END>
<BEGIN> _ thalatta ! <END>
<BEGIN> thalatta she is our great sweet mother . <END>
<BEGIN> come and look . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen stood up and went over to the parapet . <END>
<BEGIN> leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown . <END>
<BEGIN> —our mighty mother ! <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen’s face . <END>
<BEGIN> —the aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you . <END>
<BEGIN> —someone killed her , stephen said gloomily . <END>
<BEGIN> —you could have knelt down , damn it , kinch , when your dying mother asked you , buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m hyperborean as much as you . <END>
<BEGIN> but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her . <END>
<BEGIN> and you refused . <END>
<BEGIN> there is something sinister in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek . <END>
<BEGIN> a tolerant smile curled his lips . <END>
<BEGIN> —but a lovely mummer ! <END>
<BEGIN> he murmured to himself . <END>
<BEGIN> kinch , the loveliest mummer of them all ! <END>
<BEGIN> he shaved evenly and with care , in silence , seriously . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve . <END>
<BEGIN> pain , that was not yet the pain of love , fretted his heart . <END>
<BEGIN> silently , in a dream she had come to him after her death , her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , that had bent upon him , mute , reproachful , a faint odour of wetted ashes . <END>
<BEGIN> across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him . <END>
<BEGIN> the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid . <END>
<BEGIN> a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade . <END>
<BEGIN> —ah , poor dogsbody ! <END>
<BEGIN> he said in a kind voice . <END>
<BEGIN> i must give you a shirt and a few noserags . <END>
<BEGIN> how are the secondhand breeks ? <END>
<BEGIN> —they fit well enough , stephen answered . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip . <END>
<BEGIN> —the mockery of it , he said contentedly . <END>
<BEGIN> secondleg they should be . <END>
<BEGIN> god knows what poxy bowsy left them off . <END>
<BEGIN> i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey . <END>
<BEGIN> you’ll look spiffing in them . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m not joking , kinch . <END>
<BEGIN> you look damn well when you’re dressed . <END>
<BEGIN> —thanks , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> i can’t wear them if they are grey . <END>
<BEGIN> —he can’t wear them , buck mulligan told his face in the mirror . <END>
<BEGIN> etiquette is etiquette . <END>
<BEGIN> he kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers . <END>
<BEGIN> he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> —that fellow i was with in the ship last night , said buck mulligan , says you have g . p . i . he’s up in dottyville with connolly norman . <END>
<BEGIN> general paralysis of the insane ! <END>
<BEGIN> he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea . <END>
<BEGIN> his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth . <END>
<BEGIN> laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk . <END>
<BEGIN> —look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard ! <END>
<BEGIN> stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack . <END>
<BEGIN> hair on end . <END>
<BEGIN> as he and others see me . <END>
<BEGIN> who chose this face for me ? <END>
<BEGIN> this dogsbody to rid of vermin . <END>
<BEGIN> it asks me too . <END>
<BEGIN> —i pinched it out of the skivvy’s room , buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> it does her all right . <END>
<BEGIN> the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi . <END>
<BEGIN> lead him not into temptation . <END>
<BEGIN> and her name is ursula . <END>
<BEGIN> laughing again , he brought the mirror away from stephen’s peering eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> —the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> if wilde were only alive to see you ! <END>
<BEGIN> drawing back and pointing , stephen said with bitterness : —it is a symbol of irish art . <END>
<BEGIN> the cracked lookingglass of a servant . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen’s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them . <END>
<BEGIN> —it’s not fair to tease you like that , kinch , is it ? <END>
<BEGIN> he said kindly . <END>
<BEGIN> god knows you have more spirit than any of them . <END>
<BEGIN> parried again . <END>
<BEGIN> he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his . <END>
<BEGIN> the cold steel pen . <END>
<BEGIN> —cracked lookingglass of a servant ! <END>
<BEGIN> tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea . <END>
<BEGIN> he’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman . <END>
<BEGIN> his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other . <END>
<BEGIN> god , kinch , if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island . <END>
<BEGIN> hellenise it . <END>
<BEGIN> cranly’s arm . <END>
<BEGIN> his arm . <END>
<BEGIN> —and to think of your having to beg from these swine . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m the only one that knows what you are . <END>
<BEGIN> why don’t you trust me more ? <END>
<BEGIN> what have you up your nose against me ? <END>
<BEGIN> is it haines ? <END>
<BEGIN> if he makes any noise here i’ll bring down seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe . <END>
<BEGIN> young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe’s rooms . <END>
<BEGIN> palefaces : they hold their ribs with laughter , one clasping another . <END>
<BEGIN> o , i shall expire ! <END>
<BEGIN> break the news to her gently , aubrey ! <END>
<BEGIN> i shall die ! <END>
<BEGIN> with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by ades of magdalen with the tailor’s shears . <END>
<BEGIN> a scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade . <END>
<BEGIN> i don’t want to be debagged ! <END>
<BEGIN> don’t you play the giddy ox with me ! <END>
<BEGIN> shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle . <END>
<BEGIN> a deaf gardener , aproned , masked with matthew arnold’s face , pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms . <END>
<BEGIN> to <URL> new <URL> omphalos . <END>
<BEGIN> —let him stay , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> there’s nothing wrong with him except at night . <END>
<BEGIN> —then what is it ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan asked impatiently . <END>
<BEGIN> cough it up . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m quite frank with you . <END>
<BEGIN> what have you against me now ? <END>
<BEGIN> they halted , looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen freed his arm quietly . <END>
<BEGIN> —do you wish me to tell you ? <END>
<BEGIN> he asked . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , what is it ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan answered . <END>
<BEGIN> i don’t remember anything . <END>
<BEGIN> he looked in stephen’s face as he spoke . <END>
<BEGIN> a light wind passed his brow , fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , depressed by his own voice , said : —do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother’s death ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan frowned quickly and said : —what ? <END>
<BEGIN> where ? <END>
<BEGIN> i can’t remember anything . <END>
<BEGIN> i remember only ideas and sensations . <END>
<BEGIN> why ? <END>
<BEGIN> what happened in the name of god ? <END>
<BEGIN> —you were making tea , stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water . <END>
<BEGIN> your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom . <END>
<BEGIN> she asked you who was in your room . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> what did i say ? <END>
<BEGIN> i forget . <END>
<BEGIN> —you said , stephen answered , _ o , it’s only dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan’s cheek . <END>
<BEGIN> —did i say that ? <END>
<BEGIN> he asked . <END>
<BEGIN> well ? <END>
<BEGIN> what harm is that ? <END>
<BEGIN> he shook his constraint from him nervously . <END>
<BEGIN> —and what is death , he asked , your mother’s or yours or my own ? <END>
<BEGIN> you saw only your mother die . <END>
<BEGIN> i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s a beastly thing and nothing else . <END>
<BEGIN> it simply doesn’t matter . <END>
<BEGIN> you wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you . <END>
<BEGIN> why ? <END>
<BEGIN> because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you , only it’s injected the wrong way . <END>
<BEGIN> to me it’s all a mockery and beastly . <END>
<BEGIN> her cerebral lobes are not functioning . <END>
<BEGIN> she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt . <END>
<BEGIN> humour her till it’s over . <END>
<BEGIN> you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don’t whinge like some hired mute from lalouette’s . <END>
<BEGIN> absurd ! <END>
<BEGIN> i suppose i did say it . <END>
<BEGIN> i didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother . <END>
<BEGIN> he had spoken himself into boldness . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : —i am not thinking of the offence to my mother . <END>
<BEGIN> —of what then ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan asked . <END>
<BEGIN> —of the offence to me , stephen answered . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan swung round on his heel . <END>
<BEGIN> —o , an impossible person ! <END>
<BEGIN> he exclaimed . <END>
<BEGIN> he walked off quickly round the parapet . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen stood at his post , gazing over the calm sea towards the headland . <END>
<BEGIN> sea and headland now grew dim . <END>
<BEGIN> pulses were beating in his eyes , veiling their sight , and he felt the fever of his cheeks . <END>
<BEGIN> a voice within the tower called loudly : —are you up there , mulligan ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i’m coming , buck mulligan answered . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned towards stephen and said : —look at the sea . <END>
<BEGIN> what does it care about offences ? <END>
<BEGIN> chuck loyola , kinch , and come on down . <END>
<BEGIN> the sassenach wants his morning rashers . <END>
<BEGIN> his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase , level with the roof : —don’t mope over it all day , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m inconsequent . <END>
<BEGIN> give up the moody brooding . <END>
<BEGIN> his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead : and no more turn aside and brood upon love’s bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars . <END>
<BEGIN> woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed . <END>
<BEGIN> inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened , spurned by lightshod hurrying feet . <END>
<BEGIN> white breast of the dim sea . <END>
<BEGIN> the twining stresses , two by two . <END>
<BEGIN> a hand plucking the harpstrings , merging their twining chords . <END>
<BEGIN> wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide . <END>
<BEGIN> a cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green . <END>
<BEGIN> it lay beneath him , a bowl of bitter waters . <END>
<BEGIN> fergus’ song : i sang it alone in the house , holding down the long dark chords . <END>
<BEGIN> her door was open : she wanted to hear my music . <END>
<BEGIN> silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside . <END>
<BEGIN> she was crying in her wretched bed . <END>
<BEGIN> for those words , stephen : love’s bitter mystery . <END>
<BEGIN> where now ? <END>
<BEGIN> her secrets : old featherfans , tasselled dancecards , powdered with musk , a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer . <END>
<BEGIN> a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl . <END>
<BEGIN> she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang : i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility . <END>
<BEGIN> phantasmal mirth , folded away : muskperfumed . <END>
<BEGIN> and no more turn aside and brood . <END>
<BEGIN> folded away in the memory of nature with her toys . <END>
<BEGIN> memories beset his brooding brain . <END>
<BEGIN> her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament . <END>
<BEGIN> a cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening . <END>
<BEGIN> her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts . <END>
<BEGIN> in a dream , silently , she had come to him , her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , bent over him with mute secret words , a faint odour of wetted ashes . <END>
<BEGIN> her glazing eyes , staring out of death , to shake and bend my soul . <END>
<BEGIN> on me alone . <END>
<BEGIN> the ghostcandle to light her agony . <END>
<BEGIN> ghostly light on the tortured face . <END>
<BEGIN> her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror , while all prayed on their knees . <END>
<BEGIN> her eyes on me to strike me down . <END>
<BEGIN> _ liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet : iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> ghoul ! <END>
<BEGIN> chewer of corpses ! <END>
<BEGIN> no , mother ! <END>
<BEGIN> let me be and let me live . <END>
<BEGIN> —kinch ahoy ! <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower . <END>
<BEGIN> it came nearer up the staircase , calling again . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , still trembling at his soul’s cry , heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words . <END>
<BEGIN> —dedalus , come down , like a good mosey . <END>
<BEGIN> breakfast is ready . <END>
<BEGIN> haines is apologising for waking us last night . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s all right . <END>
<BEGIN> —i’m coming , stephen said , turning . <END>
<BEGIN> —do , for jesus’ sake , buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> for my sake and for all our sakes . <END>
<BEGIN> his head disappeared and reappeared . <END>
<BEGIN> —i told him your symbol of irish art . <END>
<BEGIN> he says it’s very clever . <END>
<BEGIN> touch him for a quid , will you ? <END>
<BEGIN> a guinea , i mean . <END>
<BEGIN> —i get paid this morning , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> —the school kip ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> how much ? <END>
<BEGIN> four quid ? <END>
<BEGIN> lend us one . <END>
<BEGIN> —if you want it , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> —four shining sovereigns , buck mulligan cried with delight . <END>
<BEGIN> we’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids . <END>
<BEGIN> four omnipotent sovereigns . <END>
<BEGIN> he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs , singing out of tune with a cockney accent : o , won’t we have a merry time , drinking whisky , beer and wine ! <END>
<BEGIN> on coronation , coronation day ! <END>
<BEGIN> o , won’t we have a merry time on coronation day ! <END>
<BEGIN> warm sunshine merrying over the sea . <END>
<BEGIN> the nickel shavingbowl shone , forgotten , on the parapet . <END>
<BEGIN> why should i bring it down ? <END>
<BEGIN> or leave it there all day , forgotten friendship ? <END>
<BEGIN> he went over to it , held it in his hands awhile , feeling its coolness , smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck . <END>
<BEGIN> so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes . <END>
<BEGIN> i am another now and yet the same . <END>
<BEGIN> a servant too . <END>
<BEGIN> a server of a servant . <END>
<BEGIN> in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow . <END>
<BEGIN> two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans : and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated , turning . <END>
<BEGIN> —we’ll be choked , buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> haines , open that door , will you ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker . <END>
<BEGIN> a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting , went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors . <END>
<BEGIN> —have you the key ? <END>
<BEGIN> a voice asked . <END>
<BEGIN> —dedalus has it , buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> janey mack , i’m choked ! <END>
<BEGIN> he howled , without looking up from the fire : —kinch ! <END>
<BEGIN> —it’s in the lock , stephen said , coming forward . <END>
<BEGIN> the key scraped round harshly twice and , when the heavy door had been set ajar , welcome light and bright air entered . <END>
<BEGIN> haines stood at the doorway , looking out . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him . <END>
<BEGIN> then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table , set them down heavily and sighed with relief . <END>
<BEGIN> —i’m melting , he said , as the candle remarked <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but , hush ! <END>
<BEGIN> not a word more on that subject ! <END>
<BEGIN> kinch , wake up ! <END>
<BEGIN> bread , butter , honey . <END>
<BEGIN> haines , come in . <END>
<BEGIN> the grub is ready . <END>
<BEGIN> bless us , o lord , and these thy gifts . <END>
<BEGIN> where’s the sugar ? <END>
<BEGIN> o , jay , there’s no milk . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet . <END>
<BEGIN> —what sort of a kip is this ? <END>
<BEGIN> he said . <END>
<BEGIN> i told her to come after eight . <END>
<BEGIN> —we can drink it black , stephen said thirstily . <END>
<BEGIN> there’s a lemon in the locker . <END>
<BEGIN> —o , damn you and your paris fads ! <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> i want sandycove milk . <END>
<BEGIN> haines came in from the doorway and said quietly : —that woman is coming up with the milk . <END>
<BEGIN> —the blessings of god on you ! <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan cried , jumping up from his chair . <END>
<BEGIN> sit down . <END>
<BEGIN> pour out the tea there . <END>
<BEGIN> the sugar is in the bag . <END>
<BEGIN> here , i can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs . <END>
<BEGIN> he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates , saying : — _ in nomine patris et filii et spiritus <URL> haines sat down to pour out the tea . <END>
<BEGIN> —i’m giving you two lumps each , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> but , i say , mulligan , you do make strong tea , don’t you ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old woman’s wheedling voice : —when i makes tea i makes tea , as old mother grogan said . <END>
<BEGIN> and when i makes water i makes water . <END>
<BEGIN> —by jove , it is tea , haines said . <END>

<BEGIN> he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice , lifting his brows : —can you recall , brother , is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i doubt it , said stephen gravely . <END>
<BEGIN> —do you now ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan said in the same tone . <END>
<BEGIN> your reasons , pray ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i fancy , stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion . <END>
<BEGIN> mother grogan was , one imagines , a kinswoman of mary ann . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan’s face smiled with delight . <END>
<BEGIN> —charming ! <END>
<BEGIN> he said in a finical sweet voice , showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly . <END>
<BEGIN> do you think she was ? <END>
<BEGIN> quite charming ! <END>
<BEGIN> then , suddenly overclouding all his features , he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf : _ —for old mary ann she doesn’t care a damn . <END>
<BEGIN> but , hising up her <URL> he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned . <END>
<BEGIN> the doorway was darkened by an entering form . <END>
<BEGIN> —the milk , sir ! <END>
<BEGIN> —come in , ma’am , mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> kinch , get the jug . <END>
<BEGIN> an old woman came forward and stood by stephen’s elbow . <END>
<BEGIN> —that’s a lovely morning , sir , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> glory be to god . <END>
<BEGIN> —to whom ? <END>
<BEGIN> mulligan said , glancing at her . <END>
<BEGIN> ah , to be sure ! <END>
<BEGIN> stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker . <END>
<BEGIN> —the islanders , mulligan said to haines casually , speak frequently of the collector of prepuces . <END>
<BEGIN> —how much , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> asked the old woman . <END>
<BEGIN> —a quart , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk , not hers . <END>
<BEGIN> old shrunken paps . <END>
<BEGIN> she poured again a measureful and a tilly . <END>
<BEGIN> old and secret she had entered from a morning world , maybe a messenger . <END>
<BEGIN> she praised the goodness of the milk , pouring it out . <END>
<BEGIN> crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field , a witch on her toadstool , her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs . <END>
<BEGIN> they lowed about her whom they knew , dewsilky cattle . <END>

<BEGIN> —it is indeed , ma’am , buck mulligan said , pouring milk into their cups . <END>
<BEGIN> —taste it , sir , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> he drank at her bidding . <END>
<BEGIN> —if we could live on good food like that , he said to her somewhat loudly , we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts . <END>
<BEGIN> living in a bogswamp , eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust , horsedung and consumptives’ spits . <END>
<BEGIN> —are you a medical student , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> the old woman asked . <END>
<BEGIN> —i am , ma’am , buck mulligan answered . <END>
<BEGIN> —look at that now , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen listened in scornful silence . <END>
<BEGIN> she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly , her bonesetter , her medicineman : me she slights . <END>
<BEGIN> to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins , of man’s flesh made not in god’s likeness , the serpent’s prey . <END>
<BEGIN> and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> —do you understand what he says ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen asked her . <END>
<BEGIN> —is it french you are talking , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> the old woman said to haines . <END>
<BEGIN> haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently . <END>
<BEGIN> —irish , buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> is there gaelic on you ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i thought it was irish , she said , by the sound of it . <END>
<BEGIN> are you from the west , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i am an englishman , haines answered . <END>
<BEGIN> —he’s english , buck mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland . <END>
<BEGIN> —sure we ought to , the old woman said , and i’m ashamed i don’t speak the language myself . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows . <END>
<BEGIN> —grand is no name for it , said buck mulligan . <END>
<BEGIN> wonderful entirely . <END>
<BEGIN> fill us out some more tea , kinch . <END>
<BEGIN> would you like a cup , ma’am ? <END>
<BEGIN> —no , thank you , sir , the old woman said , slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go . <END>
<BEGIN> haines said to her : —have you your bill ? <END>
<BEGIN> we had better pay her , mulligan , hadn’t we ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen filled again the three cups . <END>
<BEGIN> —bill , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> she said , halting . <END>
<BEGIN> well , it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s a shilling and one and two is two and two , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan sighed and , having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides , stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets . <END>
<BEGIN> —pay up and look pleasant , haines said to him , smiling . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen filled a third cup , a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried : —a miracle ! <END>
<BEGIN> he passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying : —ask nothing more of me , sweet . <END>
<BEGIN> all i can give you i give . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand . <END>
<BEGIN> —we’ll owe twopence , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> —time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin . <END>
<BEGIN> time enough . <END>
<BEGIN> good morning , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> she curtseyed and went out , followed by buck mulligan’s tender chant : _ —heart of my heart , were it more , more would be laid at your <URL> he turned to stephen and said : —seriously , dedalus . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m stony . <END>
<BEGIN> hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money . <END>
<BEGIN> today the bards must drink and junket . <END>
<BEGIN> ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty . <END>
<BEGIN> —that reminds me , haines said , rising , that i have to visit your national library today . <END>
<BEGIN> —our swim first , buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned to stephen and asked blandly : —is this the day for your monthly wash , kinch ? <END>
<BEGIN> then he said to haines : —the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month . <END>
<BEGIN> —all ireland is washed by the gulfstream , stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf . <END>
<BEGIN> haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke : —i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me . <END>
<BEGIN> speaking to me . <END>
<BEGIN> they wash and tub and scrub . <END>
<BEGIN> agenbite of inwit . <END>
<BEGIN> conscience . <END>
<BEGIN> yet here’s a spot . <END>
<BEGIN> —that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone : —wait till you hear him on hamlet , haines . <END>
<BEGIN> —well , i mean it , haines said , still speaking to stephen . <END>
<BEGIN> i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in . <END>
<BEGIN> —would i make any money by it ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen asked . <END>
<BEGIN> haines laughed and , as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock , said : —i don’t know , i’m sure . <END>
<BEGIN> he strolled out to the doorway . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour : —you put your hoof in it now . <END>
<BEGIN> what did you say that for ? <END>
<BEGIN> —well ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> the problem is to get money . <END>
<BEGIN> from whom ? <END>
<BEGIN> from the milkwoman or from him . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s a toss up , i think . <END>
<BEGIN> —i blow him out about you , buck mulligan said , and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes . <END>
<BEGIN> —i see little hope , stephen said , from her or from him . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen’s arm . <END>
<BEGIN> —from me , kinch , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> in a suddenly changed tone he added : —to tell you the god’s truth i think you’re right . <END>
<BEGIN> damn all else they are good for . <END>
<BEGIN> why don’t you play them as i do ? <END>
<BEGIN> to hell with them all . <END>
<BEGIN> let us get out of the kip . <END>
<BEGIN> he stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly : —mulligan is stripped of his garments . <END>
<BEGIN> he emptied his pockets on to the table . <END>
<BEGIN> —there’s your snotrag , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them , chiding them , and to his dangling watchchain . <END>
<BEGIN> his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief . <END>
<BEGIN> god , we’ll simply have to dress the character . <END>
<BEGIN> i want puce gloves and green boots . <END>
<BEGIN> contradiction . <END>
<BEGIN> do i contradict myself ? <END>
<BEGIN> very well then , i contradict myself . <END>
<BEGIN> mercurial malachi . <END>
<BEGIN> a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands . <END>
<BEGIN> —and there’s your latin quarter hat , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen picked it up and put it on . <END>
<BEGIN> haines called to them from the doorway : —are you coming , you fellows ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i’m ready , buck mulligan answered , going towards the door . <END>
<BEGIN> come out , kinch . <END>
<BEGIN> you have eaten all we left , i suppose . <END>
<BEGIN> resigned he passed out with grave words and gait , saying , wellnigh with sorrow : —and going forth he met butterly . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it . <END>
<BEGIN> he put the huge key in his inner pocket . <END>
<BEGIN> at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked : —did you bring the key ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i have it , stephen said , preceding them . <END>
<BEGIN> he walked on . <END>
<BEGIN> behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses . <END>
<BEGIN> —down , sir ! <END>
<BEGIN> how dare you , sir ! <END>
<BEGIN> haines asked : —do you pay rent for this tower ? <END>
<BEGIN> —twelve quid , buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> —to the secretary of state for war , stephen added over his shoulder . <END>
<BEGIN> they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last : —rather bleak in wintertime , i should say . <END>
<BEGIN> martello you call it ? <END>
<BEGIN> —billy pitt had them built , buck mulligan said , when the french were on the sea . <END>
<BEGIN> but ours is the _ omphalos <END>
<BEGIN> —what is your idea of hamlet ? <END>
<BEGIN> haines asked stephen . <END>
<BEGIN> —no , no , buck mulligan shouted in pain . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up . <END>
<BEGIN> wait till i have a few pints in me first . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned to stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat : —you couldn’t manage it under three pints , kinch , could you ? <END>
<BEGIN> —it has waited so long , stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer . <END>
<BEGIN> —you pique my curiosity , haines said amiably . <END>
<BEGIN> is it some paradox ? <END>
<BEGIN> —pooh ! <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s quite simple . <END>
<BEGIN> he proves by algebra that hamlet’s grandson is shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father . <END>
<BEGIN> —what ? <END>
<BEGIN> haines said , beginning to point at stephen . <END>
<BEGIN> he himself ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to stephen’s ear : —o , shade of kinch the elder ! <END>
<BEGIN> japhet in search of a father ! <END>
<BEGIN> —we’re always tired in the morning , stephen said to haines . <END>
<BEGIN> and it is rather long to tell . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands . <END>
<BEGIN> —the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> —i mean to say , haines explained to stephen as they followed , this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore . <END>
<BEGIN> _ that beetles o’er his base into the sea isn’t it ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak . <END>
<BEGIN> in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires . <END>
<BEGIN> —it’s a wonderful tale , haines said , bringing them to halt again . <END>
<BEGIN> eyes , pale as the sea the wind had freshened , paler , firm and prudent . <END>
<BEGIN> the seas’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins . <END>
<BEGIN> —i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere , he said bemused . <END>
<BEGIN> the father and the son idea . <END>
<BEGIN> the son striving to be atoned with the father . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face . <END>
<BEGIN> he looked at them , his wellshaped mouth open happily , his eyes , from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense , blinking with mad gaiety . <END>
<BEGIN> he moved a doll’s head to and fro , the brims of his panama hat quivering , and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice : _ —i’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard . <END>
<BEGIN> my mother’s a jew , my father’s a bird . <END>
<BEGIN> with joseph the joiner i cannot agree . <END>
<BEGIN> so here’s to disciples and <URL> he held up a forefinger of warning . <END>
<BEGIN> _ —if anyone thinks that i amn’t divine he’ll get no free drinks when i’m making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water <URL> he tugged swiftly at stephen’s ashplant in farewell and , running forward to a brow of the cliff , fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air , and chanted : _ —goodbye , now , goodbye ! <END>
<BEGIN> write down all i said and tell tom , dick and harry i rose from the dead . <END>
<BEGIN> what’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivet’s <URL> goodbye , now , goodbye he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole , fluttering his winglike hands , leaping nimbly , mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries . <END>
<BEGIN> haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside stephen and said : —we oughtn’t to laugh , i suppose . <END>
<BEGIN> he’s rather blasphemous . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m not a believer myself , that is to say . <END>
<BEGIN> still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn’t it ? <END>
<BEGIN> what did he call it ? <END>
<BEGIN> joseph the joiner ? <END>
<BEGIN> —the ballad of joking jesus , stephen answered . <END>
<BEGIN> —o , haines said , you have heard it before ? <END>
<BEGIN> —three times a day , after meals , stephen said drily . <END>
<BEGIN> —you’re not a believer , are you ? <END>
<BEGIN> haines asked . <END>
<BEGIN> i mean , a believer in the narrow sense of the word . <END>
<BEGIN> creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god . <END>
<BEGIN> —there’s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone . <END>
<BEGIN> he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it . <END>
<BEGIN> —thank you , stephen said , taking a cigarette . <END>
<BEGIN> haines helped himself and snapped the case to . <END>
<BEGIN> he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox , sprang it open too , and , having lit his cigarette , held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , of course , he said , as they went on again . <END>
<BEGIN> either you believe or you don’t , isn’t it ? <END>
<BEGIN> personally i couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal god . <END>
<BEGIN> you don’t stand for that , i suppose ? <END>
<BEGIN> —you behold in me , stephen said with grim displeasure , a horrible example of free thought . <END>
<BEGIN> he walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side . <END>
<BEGIN> its ferrule followed lightly on the path , squealing at his heels . <END>
<BEGIN> my familiar , after me , calling , steeeeeeeeeeeephen ! <END>
<BEGIN> a wavering line along the path . <END>
<BEGIN> they will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark . <END>
<BEGIN> he wants that key . <END>
<BEGIN> it is mine . <END>
<BEGIN> i paid the rent . <END>
<BEGIN> now i eat his salt bread . <END>
<BEGIN> give him the key too . <END>
<BEGIN> all . <END>
<BEGIN> he will ask for it . <END>
<BEGIN> that was in his eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> —after all , haines <URL> stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind . <END>
<BEGIN> —after all , i should think you are able to free yourself . <END>
<BEGIN> you are your own master , it seems to me . <END>
<BEGIN> —i am a servant of two masters , stephen said , an english and an italian . <END>
<BEGIN> —italian ? <END>
<BEGIN> haines said . <END>
<BEGIN> a crazy queen , old and jealous . <END>
<BEGIN> kneel down before me . <END>
<BEGIN> —and a third , stephen said , there is who wants me for odd jobs . <END>
<BEGIN> —italian ? <END>
<BEGIN> haines said again . <END>
<BEGIN> what do you mean ? <END>
<BEGIN> —the imperial british state , stephen answered , his colour rising , and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church . <END>
<BEGIN> haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke . <END>
<BEGIN> —i can quite understand that , he said calmly . <END>
<BEGIN> an irishman must think like that , i daresay . <END>
<BEGIN> we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly . <END>
<BEGIN> it seems history is to blame . <END>
<BEGIN> the proud potent titles clanged over stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells : _ et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars . <END>
<BEGIN> symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus , the voices blended , singing alone loud in affirmation : and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs . <END>
<BEGIN> a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry : photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one , and arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father , and valentine , spurning christ’s terrene body , and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son . <END>
<BEGIN> words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger . <END>
<BEGIN> idle mockery . <END>
<BEGIN> the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind : a menace , a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church , michael’s host , who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields . <END>
<BEGIN> hear , hear ! <END>
<BEGIN> prolonged applause . <END>
<BEGIN> _ zut ! <END>
<BEGIN> nom de dieu —of course i’m a britisher , haines’s voice said , and i feel as one . <END>
<BEGIN> i don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s our national problem , i’m afraid , just now . <END>
<BEGIN> two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching : businessman , boatman . <END>
<BEGIN> —she’s making for bullock harbour . <END>
<BEGIN> the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain . <END>
<BEGIN> —there’s five fathoms out there , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> it’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s nine days today . <END>
<BEGIN> the man that was drowned . <END>
<BEGIN> a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite . <END>
<BEGIN> here i am . <END>
<BEGIN> they followed the winding path down to the creek . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder . <END>
<BEGIN> a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water . <END>
<BEGIN> —is the brother with you , malachi ? <END>
<BEGIN> —down in westmeath . <END>
<BEGIN> with the bannons . <END>
<BEGIN> —still there ? <END>
<BEGIN> i got a card from bannon . <END>
<BEGIN> says he found a sweet young thing down there . <END>
<BEGIN> photo girl he calls her . <END>
<BEGIN> —snapshot , eh ? <END>
<BEGIN> brief exposure . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots . <END>
<BEGIN> an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face . <END>
<BEGIN> he scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at haines and stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone . <END>
<BEGIN> —seymour’s back in town , the young man said , grasping again his spur of rock . <END>
<BEGIN> chucked medicine and going in for the army . <END>
<BEGIN> —ah , go to god ! <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> —going over next week to stew . <END>
<BEGIN> you know that red carlisle girl , lily ? <END>
<BEGIN> —yes . <END>
<BEGIN> —spooning with him last night on the pier . <END>
<BEGIN> the father is rotto with money . <END>
<BEGIN> —is she up the pole ? <END>
<BEGIN> —better ask seymour that . <END>
<BEGIN> —seymour a bleeding officer ! <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan said . <END>
<BEGIN> he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely : —redheaded women buck like goats . <END>
<BEGIN> he broke off in alarm , feeling his side under his flapping shirt . <END>
<BEGIN> —my twelfth rib is gone , he cried . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m the <URL> toothless kinch and i , the supermen . <END>
<BEGIN> he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay . <END>
<BEGIN> —are you going in here , malachi ? <END>
<BEGIN> —yes . <END>
<BEGIN> make room in the bed . <END>
<BEGIN> the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes . <END>
<BEGIN> haines sat down on a stone , smoking . <END>
<BEGIN> —are you not coming in ? <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan asked . <END>
<BEGIN> —later on , haines said . <END>
<BEGIN> not on my breakfast . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen turned away . <END>
<BEGIN> —i’m going , mulligan , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> —give us that key , kinch , buck mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen handed him the key . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes . <END>
<BEGIN> —and twopence , he said , for a pint . <END>
<BEGIN> throw it there . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap . <END>
<BEGIN> dressing , undressing . <END>
<BEGIN> buck mulligan erect , with joined hands before him , said solemnly : —he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord . <END>
<BEGIN> thus spake zarathustra . <END>
<BEGIN> his plump body plunged . <END>
<BEGIN> —we’ll see you again , haines said , turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish . <END>

<BEGIN> —the ship , buck mulligan cried . <END>
<BEGIN> half twelve . <END>

<BEGIN> in a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay . <END>
<BEGIN> —tell me now , stephen said , poking the boy’s shoulder with the book , what is a pier . <END>
<BEGIN> —a pier , sir , armstrong said . <END>
<BEGIN> a thing out in the water . <END>
<BEGIN> a kind of a bridge . <END>

<BEGIN> a jester at the court of his master , indulged and disesteemed , winning a clement master’s praise . <END>
<BEGIN> why had they chosen all that part ? <END>

<BEGIN> go on , talbot . <END>
<BEGIN> a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel . <END>
<BEGIN> he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text : _ —weep no more , woful shepherds , weep no more for lycidas , your sorrow , is not dead , sunk though he be beneath the watery <URL> it must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible . <END>
<BEGIN> aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read , sheltered from the sin of paris , night by night . <END>
<BEGIN> by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy . <END>
<BEGIN> fed and feeding brains about me : under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers : and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds . <END>
<BEGIN> thought is the thought of thought . <END>
<BEGIN> tranquil brightness . <END>
<BEGIN> the soul is in a manner all that is : the soul is the form of forms . <END>
<BEGIN> tranquility sudden , vast , candescent : form of forms . <END>

<BEGIN> i don’t see anything . <END>
<BEGIN> —what , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> talbot asked simply , bending forward . <END>
<BEGIN> his hand turned the page over . <END>
<BEGIN> he leaned back and went on again , having just remembered . <END>
<BEGIN> of him that walked the waves . <END>
<BEGIN> here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine . <END>
<BEGIN> it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute . <END>

<BEGIN> my father gave me seeds to sow . <END>
<BEGIN> talbot slid his closed book into his satchel . <END>

<BEGIN> hockey at ten , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> —half day , sir . <END>

<BEGIN> —who can answer a riddle ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen asked . <END>
<BEGIN> they bundled their books away , pencils clacking , pages rustling . <END>
<BEGIN> crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels , all gabbling gaily : —a riddle , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> ask me , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> —o , ask me , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> —a hard one , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> —this is the riddle , stephen said : the cock crew , the sky was blue : the bells in heaven were striking eleven . <END>
<BEGIN> ’tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven . <END>
<BEGIN> what is that ? <END>
<BEGIN> —what , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> —again , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> we didn’t hear . <END>
<BEGIN> their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated . <END>
<BEGIN> after a silence cochrane said : —what is it , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> we give it up . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , his throat itching , answered : —the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush . <END>
<BEGIN> he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay . <END>
<BEGIN> a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called : —hockey ! <END>
<BEGIN> they broke asunder , sidling out of their benches , leaping them . <END>
<BEGIN> quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues . <END>
<BEGIN> sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook . <END>
<BEGIN> his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading . <END>
<BEGIN> on his cheek , dull and bloodless , a soft stain of ink lay , dateshaped , recent and damp as a snail’s bed . <END>
<BEGIN> he held out his copybook . <END>
<BEGIN> the word _ sums _ was written on the headline . <END>
<BEGIN> beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot . <END>
<BEGIN> cyril sargent : his name and seal . <END>
<BEGIN> —mr deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen touched the edges of the book . <END>
<BEGIN> futility . <END>
<BEGIN> —do you understand how to do them now ? <END>
<BEGIN> he asked . <END>
<BEGIN> —numbers eleven to fifteen , sargent answered . <END>
<BEGIN> mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> —can you do them yourself ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen asked . <END>
<BEGIN> —no , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> ugly and futile : lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink , a snail’s bed . <END>
<BEGIN> yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in her heart . <END>
<BEGIN> but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot , a squashed boneless snail . <END>
<BEGIN> she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own . <END>
<BEGIN> was that then real ? <END>
<BEGIN> the only true thing in life ? <END>
<BEGIN> his mother’s prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode . <END>
<BEGIN> she was no more : the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire , an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes . <END>
<BEGIN> she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been . <END>
<BEGIN> a poor soul gone to heaven : and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox , red reek of rapine in his fur , with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth , listened , scraped up the earth , listened , scraped and scraped . <END>
<BEGIN> sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem . <END>
<BEGIN> he proves by algebra that shakespeare’s ghost is hamlet’s grandfather . <END>
<BEGIN> sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses . <END>
<BEGIN> hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom : the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field . <END>
<BEGIN> across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice , in the mummery of their letters , wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes . <END>
<BEGIN> give hands , traverse , bow to partner : so : imps of fancy of the moors . <END>
<BEGIN> gone too from the world , averroes and moses maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend . <END>
<BEGIN> —do you understand now ? <END>
<BEGIN> can you work the second for yourself ? <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data . <END>
<BEGIN> waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols , a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin . <END>
<BEGIN> _ amor matris subjective and objective genitive . <END>
<BEGIN> with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands . <END>
<BEGIN> like him was i , these sloping shoulders , this gracelessness . <END>
<BEGIN> my childhood bends beside me . <END>
<BEGIN> too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly . <END>
<BEGIN> mine is far and his secret as our eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts : secrets weary of their tyranny : tyrants , willing to be dethroned . <END>
<BEGIN> the sum was done . <END>
<BEGIN> —it is very simple , stephen said as he stood up . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> thanks , sargent answered . <END>
<BEGIN> he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench . <END>
<BEGIN> —you had better get your stick and go out to the others , stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> in the corridor his name was heard , called from the playfield . <END>
<BEGIN> —sargent ! <END>
<BEGIN> —run on , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> mr deasy is calling you . <END>
<BEGIN> he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife . <END>
<BEGIN> they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet . <END>
<BEGIN> when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned his angry white moustache . <END>
<BEGIN> —what is it now ? <END>
<BEGIN> he cried continually without listening . <END>
<BEGIN> —cochrane and halliday are on the same side , sir , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> —will you wait in my study for a moment , mr deasy said , till i restore order here . <END>
<BEGIN> and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly : —what is the matter ? <END>
<BEGIN> what is it now ? <END>
<BEGIN> their sharp voices cried about him on all sides : their many forms closed round him , the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head . <END>
<BEGIN> stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs . <END>
<BEGIN> as on the first day he bargained with me here . <END>
<BEGIN> as it was in the beginning , is now . <END>
<BEGIN> on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins , base treasure of a bog : and ever shall be . <END>
<BEGIN> and snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles : world without end . <END>
<BEGIN> a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor . <END>
<BEGIN> blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table . <END>
<BEGIN> —first , our little financial settlement , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong . <END>
<BEGIN> it slapped open and he took from it two notes , one of joined halves , and laid them carefully on the table . <END>
<BEGIN> —two , he said , strapping and stowing his pocketbook away . <END>
<BEGIN> and now his strongroom for the gold . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar : whelks and money cowries and leopard shells : and this , whorled as an emir’s turban , and this , the scallop of saint james . <END>
<BEGIN> an old pilgrim’s hoard , dead treasure , hollow shells . <END>
<BEGIN> a sovereign fell , bright and new , on the soft pile of the tablecloth . <END>
<BEGIN> —three , mr deasy said , turning his little savingsbox about in his hand . <END>
<BEGIN> these are handy things to have . <END>
<BEGIN> see . <END>
<BEGIN> this is for sovereigns . <END>
<BEGIN> this is for shillings . <END>
<BEGIN> sixpences , halfcrowns . <END>
<BEGIN> and here crowns . <END>
<BEGIN> see . <END>
<BEGIN> he shot from it two crowns and two shillings . <END>
<BEGIN> —three twelve , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> i think you’ll find that’s right . <END>
<BEGIN> —thank you , sir , stephen said , gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers . <END>
<BEGIN> —no thanks at all , mr deasy said . <END>
<BEGIN> you have earned it . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen’s hand , free again , went back to the hollow shells . <END>
<BEGIN> symbols too of beauty and of power . <END>
<BEGIN> a lump in my pocket : symbols soiled by greed and misery . <END>
<BEGIN> —don’t carry it like that , mr deasy said . <END>
<BEGIN> you’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it . <END>
<BEGIN> you just buy one of these machines . <END>
<BEGIN> you’ll find them very handy . <END>
<BEGIN> answer something . <END>
<BEGIN> —mine would be often empty , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> the same room and hour , the same wisdom : and i the same . <END>
<BEGIN> three times now . <END>
<BEGIN> three nooses round me here . <END>
<BEGIN> well ? <END>
<BEGIN> i can break them in this instant if i will . <END>
<BEGIN> —because you don’t save , mr deasy said , pointing his finger . <END>
<BEGIN> you don’t know yet what money is . <END>
<BEGIN> money is power . <END>
<BEGIN> when you have lived as long as i have . <END>
<BEGIN> i know , i know . <END>
<BEGIN> if youth but knew . <END>
<BEGIN> but what does shakespeare say ? <END>
<BEGIN> _ put but money in thy <URL> —iago , stephen murmured . <END>
<BEGIN> he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare . <END>
<BEGIN> —he knew what money was , mr deasy said . <END>
<BEGIN> he made money . <END>
<BEGIN> a poet , yes , but an englishman too . <END>
<BEGIN> do you know what is the pride of the english ? <END>
<BEGIN> do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishman’s mouth ? <END>
<BEGIN> the seas’ ruler . <END>
<BEGIN> his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay : it seems history is to blame : on me and on my words , unhating . <END>
<BEGIN> —that on his empire , stephen said , the sun never sets . <END>
<BEGIN> —ba ! <END>
<BEGIN> mr deasy cried . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s not english . <END>
<BEGIN> a french celt said that . <END>
<BEGIN> he tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail . <END>
<BEGIN> —i will tell you , he said solemnly , what is his proudest boast . <END>
<BEGIN> _ i paid my <URL> good man , good man . <END>
<BEGIN> _ —i paid my way . <END>
<BEGIN> i never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> can you feel that ? <END>

<BEGIN> the lump i have is useless . <END>
<BEGIN> —for the moment , no , stephen answered . <END>
<BEGIN> mr deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox . <END>
<BEGIN> —i knew you couldn’t , he said joyously . <END>
<BEGIN> but one day you must feel it . <END>
<BEGIN> we are a generous people but we must also be just . <END>
<BEGIN> —i fear those big words , stephen said , which make us so unhappy . <END>
<BEGIN> mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs : albert edward , prince of wales . <END>
<BEGIN> —you think me an old fogey and an old tory , his thoughtful voice said . <END>
<BEGIN> i saw three generations since o’connell’s time . <END>
<BEGIN> i remember the famine in ’46 . <END>
<BEGIN> do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before o’connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue ? <END>

<BEGIN> on the spindle side . <END>
<BEGIN> but i am descended from sir john blackwood who voted for the union . <END>
<BEGIN> we are all irish , all kings’ sons . <END>

<BEGIN> i have a letter here for the press . <END>
<BEGIN> sit down a moment . <END>
<BEGIN> i have just to copy the end . <END>
<BEGIN> he went to the desk near the window , pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter . <END>
<BEGIN> —sit down . <END>
<BEGIN> excuse me , he said over his shoulder , _ the dictates of common <URL> just a moment . <END>
<BEGIN> he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and , muttering , began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly , sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error . <END>

<BEGIN> he saw their speeds , backing king’s colours , and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds . <END>
<BEGIN> —full stop , mr deasy bade his keys . <END>
<BEGIN> _ but prompt ventilation of this allimportant <URL> where cranly led me to get rich quick , hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes , amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen , over the motley slush . <END>

<BEGIN> he came to the table , pinning together his sheets . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen stood up . <END>
<BEGIN> —i have put the matter into a nutshell , mr deasy said . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s about the foot and mouth disease . <END>

<BEGIN> england is in the hands of the jews . <END>
<BEGIN> in all the highest places : her finance , her press . <END>

<BEGIN> a whirring whistle : goal . <END>
<BEGIN> what if that nightmare gave you a back kick ? <END>
<BEGIN> —the ways of the creator are not our ways , mr deasy said . <END>

<BEGIN> —i am happier than you are , he said . <END>

<BEGIN> stephen raised the sheets in his hand . <END>
<BEGIN> —well , sir , he began . <END>

<BEGIN> and here what will you learn more ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr deasy shook his head . <END>

<BEGIN> —yes , sir , stephen said , turning back at the gate . <END>
<BEGIN> mr deasy halted , breathing hard and swallowing his breath . <END>

<BEGIN> no . <END>
<BEGIN> and do you know why ? <END>
<BEGIN> he frowned sternly on the bright air . <END>
<BEGIN> —why , sir ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen asked , beginning to smile . <END>
<BEGIN> —because she never let them in , mr deasy said solemnly . <END>
<BEGIN> a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned back quickly , coughing , laughing , his lifted arms waving to the air . <END>
<BEGIN> —she never let them in , he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s why . <END>

<BEGIN> he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly . <END>
<BEGIN> wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after . <END>
<BEGIN> why ? <END>
<BEGIN> they shine in the dark , perhaps , the tips . <END>
<BEGIN> or kind of feelers in the dark , perhaps . <END>
<BEGIN> he listened to her licking lap . <END>
<BEGIN> ham and eggs , no . <END>
<BEGIN> no good eggs with this drouth . <END>
<BEGIN> want pure fresh water . <END>
<BEGIN> thursday : not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckley’s . <END>
<BEGIN> fried with butter , a shake of pepper . <END>
<BEGIN> better a pork kidney at dlugacz’s . <END>
<BEGIN> while the kettle is boiling . <END>
<BEGIN> she lapped slower , then licking the saucer clean . <END>
<BEGIN> why are their tongues so rough ? <END>
<BEGIN> to lap better , all porous holes . <END>
<BEGIN> nothing she can eat ? <END>
<BEGIN> he glanced round him . <END>
<BEGIN> no . <END>
<BEGIN> on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall , paused by the bedroom door . <END>
<BEGIN> she might like something tasty . <END>
<BEGIN> thin bread and butter she likes in the morning . <END>
<BEGIN> still perhaps : once in a way . <END>
<BEGIN> he said softly in the bare hall : —i’m going round the corner . <END>
<BEGIN> be back in a minute . <END>
<BEGIN> and when he had heard his voice say it he added : —you don’t want anything for breakfast ? <END>
<BEGIN> a sleepy soft grunt answered : —mn . <END>
<BEGIN> no . <END>
<BEGIN> she didn’t want anything . <END>
<BEGIN> he heard then a warm heavy sigh , softer , as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled . <END>
<BEGIN> must get those settled really . <END>
<BEGIN> pity . <END>
<BEGIN> all the way from gibraltar . <END>
<BEGIN> forgotten any little spanish she knew . <END>
<BEGIN> wonder what her father gave for it . <END>
<BEGIN> old style . <END>
<BEGIN> ah yes ! <END>
<BEGIN> of course . <END>
<BEGIN> bought it at the governor’s auction . <END>
<BEGIN> got a short knock . <END>
<BEGIN> hard as nails at a bargain , old tweedy . <END>
<BEGIN> yes , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> at plevna that was . <END>
<BEGIN> i rose from the ranks , sir , and i’m proud of it . <END>
<BEGIN> still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps . <END>
<BEGIN> now that was farseeing . <END>
<BEGIN> his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof . <END>
<BEGIN> stamps : stickyback pictures . <END>
<BEGIN> daresay lots of officers are in the swim too . <END>
<BEGIN> course they do . <END>
<BEGIN> the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely : plasto’s high grade ha . <END>
<BEGIN> he peeped quickly inside the leather headband . <END>
<BEGIN> white slip of paper . <END>
<BEGIN> quite safe . <END>
<BEGIN> on the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey . <END>
<BEGIN> not there . <END>
<BEGIN> in the trousers i left off . <END>
<BEGIN> must get it . <END>
<BEGIN> potato i have . <END>
<BEGIN> creaky wardrobe . <END>
<BEGIN> no use disturbing her . <END>
<BEGIN> she turned over sleepily that time . <END>
<BEGIN> he pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly , more , till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold , a limp lid . <END>
<BEGIN> looked shut . <END>
<BEGIN> all right till i come back anyhow . <END>
<BEGIN> he crossed to the bright side , avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive . <END>
<BEGIN> the sun was nearing the steeple of george’s church . <END>
<BEGIN> be a warm day i fancy . <END>
<BEGIN> specially in these black clothes feel it more . <END>
<BEGIN> black conducts , reflects , ( refracts is it ? <END>
<BEGIN> the heat . <END>
<BEGIN> but i couldn’t go in that light suit . <END>
<BEGIN> make a picnic of it . <END>
<BEGIN> his eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth . <END>
<BEGIN> boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot . <END>
<BEGIN> makes you feel young . <END>
<BEGIN> somewhere in the east : early morning : set off at dawn . <END>
<BEGIN> travel round in front of the sun , steal a day’s march on him . <END>
<BEGIN> keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically . <END>
<BEGIN> walk along a strand , strange land , come to a city gate , sentry there , old ranker too , old tweedy’s big moustaches , leaning on a long kind of a spear . <END>
<BEGIN> wander through awned streets . <END>
<BEGIN> turbaned faces going by . <END>
<BEGIN> dark caves of carpet shops , big man , turko the terrible , seated crosslegged , smoking a coiled pipe . <END>
<BEGIN> cries of sellers in the streets . <END>
<BEGIN> drink water scented with fennel , sherbet . <END>
<BEGIN> dander along all day . <END>
<BEGIN> might meet a robber or two . <END>
<BEGIN> well , meet him . <END>
<BEGIN> getting on to sundown . <END>
<BEGIN> the shadows of the mosques among the pillars : priest with a scroll rolled up . <END>
<BEGIN> a shiver of the trees , signal , the evening wind . <END>
<BEGIN> i pass on . <END>
<BEGIN> fading gold sky . <END>
<BEGIN> a mother watches me from her doorway . <END>
<BEGIN> she calls her children home in their dark language . <END>
<BEGIN> high wall : beyond strings twanged . <END>
<BEGIN> night sky , moon , violet , colour of molly’s new garters . <END>
<BEGIN> strings . <END>
<BEGIN> listen . <END>
<BEGIN> a girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them : dulcimers . <END>
<BEGIN> i pass . <END>
<BEGIN> probably not a bit like it really . <END>
<BEGIN> kind of stuff you read : in the track of the sun . <END>
<BEGIN> sunburst on the titlepage . <END>
<BEGIN> he smiled , pleasing himself . <END>
<BEGIN> what arthur griffith said about the headpiece over the _ freeman _ leader : a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of ireland . <END>
<BEGIN> he prolonged his pleased smile . <END>
<BEGIN> ikey touch that : homerule sun rising up in the northwest . <END>
<BEGIN> he approached larry o’rourke’s . <END>
<BEGIN> from the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter . <END>
<BEGIN> through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger , teadust , biscuitmush . <END>
<BEGIN> good house , however : just the end of the city traffic . <END>
<BEGIN> for instance m’auley’s down there : n . g . as position . <END>
<BEGIN> of course if they ran a tramline along the north circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot . <END>
<BEGIN> baldhead over the blind . <END>
<BEGIN> cute old codger . <END>
<BEGIN> no use canvassing him for an ad . <END>
<BEGIN> still he knows his own business best . <END>
<BEGIN> there he is , sure enough , my bold larry , leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket . <END>
<BEGIN> simon dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up . <END>
<BEGIN> do you know what i’m going to tell you ? <END>
<BEGIN> what’s that , mr o’rourke ? <END>
<BEGIN> do you know what ? <END>
<BEGIN> the russians , they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the japanese . <END>
<BEGIN> stop and say a word : about the funeral perhaps . <END>
<BEGIN> sad thing about poor dignam , mr o’rourke . <END>
<BEGIN> turning into dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway : —good day , mr o’rourke . <END>
<BEGIN> —good day to you . <END>
<BEGIN> —lovely weather , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> —’tis all that . <END>
<BEGIN> where do they get the money ? <END>
<BEGIN> coming up redheaded curates from the county leitrim , rinsing empties and old man in the cellar . <END>
<BEGIN> then , lo and behold , they blossom out as adam findlaters or dan tallons . <END>
<BEGIN> then think of the competition . <END>
<BEGIN> general thirst . <END>
<BEGIN> good puzzle would be cross dublin without passing a pub . <END>
<BEGIN> save it they can’t . <END>
<BEGIN> off the drunks perhaps . <END>
<BEGIN> put down three and carry five . <END>
<BEGIN> what is that , a bob here and there , dribs and drabs . <END>
<BEGIN> on the wholesale orders perhaps . <END>
<BEGIN> doing a double shuffle with the town travellers . <END>
<BEGIN> square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job , see ? <END>
<BEGIN> how much would that tot to off the porter in the month ? <END>
<BEGIN> say ten barrels of stuff . <END>
<BEGIN> say he got ten per cent off . <END>
<BEGIN> o more . <END>
<BEGIN> fifteen . <END>

<BEGIN> he halted before dlugacz’s window , staring at the hanks of sausages , polonies , black and white . <END>
<BEGIN> fifteen multiplied by . <END>
<BEGIN> the figures whitened in his mind , unsolved : displeased , he let them fade . <END>
<BEGIN> the shiny links , packed with forcemeat , fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood . <END>
<BEGIN> a kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish : the last . <END>
<BEGIN> he stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter . <END>
<BEGIN> would she buy it too , calling the items from a slip in her hand ? <END>
<BEGIN> chapped : washingsoda . <END>
<BEGIN> and a pound and a half of denny’s sausages . <END>
<BEGIN> his eyes rested on her vigorous hips . <END>

<BEGIN> she does whack it , by george . <END>
<BEGIN> the way her crooked skirt swings at each whack . <END>
<BEGIN> the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers , sausagepink . <END>
<BEGIN> sound meat there : like a stallfed heifer . <END>
<BEGIN> he took a page up from the pile of cut sheets : the model farm at kinnereth on the lakeshore of tiberias . <END>
<BEGIN> can become ideal winter sanatorium . <END>
<BEGIN> moses montefiore . <END>
<BEGIN> i thought he was . <END>
<BEGIN> farmhouse , wall round it , blurred cattle cropping . <END>
<BEGIN> he held the page from him : interesting : read it nearer , the title , the blurred cropping cattle , the page rustling . <END>
<BEGIN> a young white heifer . <END>
<BEGIN> those mornings in the cattlemarket , the beasts lowing in their pens , branded sheep , flop and fall of dung , the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter , slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter , there’s a prime one , unpeeled switches in their hands . <END>
<BEGIN> he held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest . <END>
<BEGIN> the crooked skirt swinging , whack by whack by whack . <END>
<BEGIN> the porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile , wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace . <END>
<BEGIN> —now , my miss , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> she tendered a coin , smiling boldly , holding her thick wrist out . <END>
<BEGIN> —thank you , my miss . <END>
<BEGIN> and one shilling threepence change . <END>
<BEGIN> for you , please ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom pointed quickly . <END>
<BEGIN> to catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly , behind her moving hams . <END>
<BEGIN> pleasant to see first thing in the morning . <END>
<BEGIN> hurry up , damn it . <END>
<BEGIN> make hay while the sun shines . <END>
<BEGIN> she stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right . <END>
<BEGIN> he sighed down his nose : they never understand . <END>
<BEGIN> sodachapped hands . <END>
<BEGIN> crusted toenails too . <END>
<BEGIN> brown scapulars in tatters , defending her both ways . <END>
<BEGIN> the sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast . <END>
<BEGIN> for another : a constable off duty cuddling her in eccles’ lane . <END>
<BEGIN> they like them sizeable . <END>
<BEGIN> prime sausage . <END>
<BEGIN> o please , mr policeman , i’m lost in the wood . <END>
<BEGIN> —threepence , please . <END>
<BEGIN> his hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket . <END>
<BEGIN> then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles . <END>
<BEGIN> they lay , were read quickly and quickly slid , disc by disc , into the till . <END>
<BEGIN> —thank you , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> another time . <END>
<BEGIN> a speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him . <END>
<BEGIN> he withdrew his gaze after an instant . <END>
<BEGIN> no : better not : another time . <END>
<BEGIN> —good morning , he said , moving away . <END>
<BEGIN> —good morning , sir . <END>
<BEGIN> no sign . <END>
<BEGIN> gone . <END>
<BEGIN> what matter ? <END>
<BEGIN> he walked back along dorset street , reading gravely . <END>
<BEGIN> agendath netaim : planters’ company . <END>
<BEGIN> to purchase waste sandy tracts from turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees . <END>
<BEGIN> excellent for shade , fuel and construction . <END>
<BEGIN> orangegroves and immense melonfields north of jaffa . <END>
<BEGIN> you pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives , oranges , almonds or citrons . <END>
<BEGIN> olives cheaper : oranges need artificial irrigation . <END>
<BEGIN> every year you get a sending of the crop . <END>
<BEGIN> your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union . <END>
<BEGIN> can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments . <END>
<BEGIN> bleibtreustrasse 34 , berlin , w . 15 . <END>
<BEGIN> nothing doing . <END>
<BEGIN> still an idea behind it . <END>
<BEGIN> he looked at the cattle , blurred in silver heat . <END>
<BEGIN> silverpowdered olivetrees . <END>
<BEGIN> quiet long days : pruning , ripening . <END>
<BEGIN> olives are packed in jars , eh ? <END>
<BEGIN> i have a few left from andrews . <END>
<BEGIN> molly spitting them out . <END>
<BEGIN> knows the taste of them now . <END>
<BEGIN> oranges in tissue paper packed in crates . <END>
<BEGIN> citrons too . <END>
<BEGIN> wonder is poor citron still in saint kevin’s parade . <END>
<BEGIN> and mastiansky with the old cither . <END>
<BEGIN> pleasant evenings we had then . <END>
<BEGIN> molly in citron’s basketchair . <END>
<BEGIN> nice to hold , cool waxen fruit , hold in the hand , lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume . <END>
<BEGIN> like that , heavy , sweet , wild perfume . <END>
<BEGIN> always the same , year after year . <END>
<BEGIN> they fetched high prices too , moisel told me . <END>
<BEGIN> arbutus place : pleasants street : pleasant old times . <END>
<BEGIN> must be without a flaw , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> coming all that way : spain , gibraltar , mediterranean , the levant . <END>
<BEGIN> crates lined up on the quayside at jaffa , chap ticking them off in a book , navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees . <END>
<BEGIN> there’s whatdoyoucallhim out of . <END>
<BEGIN> how do you ? <END>
<BEGIN> doesn’t see . <END>
<BEGIN> chap you know just to salute bit of a bore . <END>

<BEGIN> watering cart . <END>
<BEGIN> to provoke the rain . <END>
<BEGIN> on earth as it is in heaven . <END>
<BEGIN> a cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly . <END>
<BEGIN> grey . <END>
<BEGIN> far . <END>
<BEGIN> no , not like that . <END>
<BEGIN> a barren land , bare waste . <END>
<BEGIN> vulcanic lake , the dead sea : no fish , weedless , sunk deep in the earth . <END>
<BEGIN> no wind could lift those waves , grey metal , poisonous foggy waters . <END>
<BEGIN> brimstone they called it raining down : the cities of the plain : sodom , gomorrah , edom . <END>
<BEGIN> all dead names . <END>
<BEGIN> a dead sea in a dead land , grey and old . <END>
<BEGIN> old now . <END>
<BEGIN> it bore the oldest , the first race . <END>
<BEGIN> a bent hag crossed from cassidy’s , clutching a naggin bottle by the neck . <END>
<BEGIN> the oldest people . <END>
<BEGIN> wandered far away over all the earth , captivity to captivity , multiplying , dying , being born everywhere . <END>
<BEGIN> it lay there now . <END>
<BEGIN> now it could bear no more . <END>
<BEGIN> dead : an old woman’s : the grey sunken cunt of the world . <END>
<BEGIN> desolation . <END>
<BEGIN> grey horror seared his flesh . <END>
<BEGIN> folding the page into his pocket he turned into eccles street , hurrying homeward . <END>
<BEGIN> cold oils slid along his veins , chilling his blood : age crusting him with a salt cloak . <END>
<BEGIN> well , i am here now . <END>
<BEGIN> yes , i am here now . <END>
<BEGIN> morning mouth bad images . <END>
<BEGIN> got up wrong side of the bed . <END>
<BEGIN> must begin again those sandow’s exercises . <END>
<BEGIN> on the hands down . <END>
<BEGIN> blotchy brown brick houses . <END>
<BEGIN> number eighty still unlet . <END>
<BEGIN> why is that ? <END>
<BEGIN> valuation is only twentyeight . <END>
<BEGIN> towers , battersby , north , macarthur : parlour windows plastered with bills . <END>
<BEGIN> plasters on a sore eye . <END>
<BEGIN> to smell the gentle smoke of tea , fume of the pan , sizzling butter . <END>
<BEGIN> be near her ample bedwarmed flesh . <END>
<BEGIN> yes , yes . <END>
<BEGIN> quick warm sunlight came running from berkeley road , swiftly , in slim sandals , along the brightening footpath . <END>
<BEGIN> runs , she runs to meet me , a girl with gold hair on the wind . <END>
<BEGIN> two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor . <END>
<BEGIN> he stooped and gathered them . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs marion bloom . <END>
<BEGIN> his quickened heart slowed at once . <END>
<BEGIN> bold hand . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs marion . <END>
<BEGIN> —poldy ! <END>
<BEGIN> entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head . <END>
<BEGIN> —who are the letters for ? <END>
<BEGIN> he looked at them . <END>
<BEGIN> mullingar . <END>
<BEGIN> milly . <END>
<BEGIN> —a letter for me from milly , he said carefully , and a card to you . <END>
<BEGIN> and a letter for you . <END>
<BEGIN> he laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees . <END>
<BEGIN> —do you want the blind up ? <END>
<BEGIN> letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow . <END>
<BEGIN> —that do ? <END>
<BEGIN> he asked , turning . <END>
<BEGIN> she was reading the card , propped on her elbow . <END>
<BEGIN> —she got the things , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> he waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh . <END>
<BEGIN> —hurry up with that tea , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m parched . <END>
<BEGIN> —the kettle is boiling , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> but he delayed to clear the chair : her striped petticoat , tossed soiled linen : and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed . <END>
<BEGIN> as he went down the kitchen stairs she called : —poldy ! <END>
<BEGIN> —what ? <END>
<BEGIN> —scald the teapot . <END>
<BEGIN> on the boil sure enough : a plume of steam from the spout . <END>
<BEGIN> he scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea , tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in . <END>
<BEGIN> having set it to draw he took off the kettle , crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt . <END>
<BEGIN> while he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him . <END>
<BEGIN> give her too much meat she won’t mouse . <END>
<BEGIN> say they won’t eat pork . <END>
<BEGIN> kosher . <END>
<BEGIN> here . <END>
<BEGIN> he let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce . <END>
<BEGIN> pepper . <END>
<BEGIN> he sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup . <END>
<BEGIN> then he slit open his letter , glancing down the page and over . <END>
<BEGIN> thanks : new tam : mr coghlan : lough owel picnic : young student : blazes boylan’s seaside girls . <END>
<BEGIN> the tea was drawn . <END>
<BEGIN> he filled his own moustachecup , sham crown derby , smiling . <END>
<BEGIN> silly milly’s birthday gift . <END>
<BEGIN> only five she was then . <END>
<BEGIN> no , wait : four . <END>
<BEGIN> i gave her the amberoid necklace she broke . <END>
<BEGIN> putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her . <END>
<BEGIN> he smiled , pouring . <END>
<BEGIN> o , milly bloom , you are my darling . <END>
<BEGIN> you are my lookingglass from night to morning . <END>
<BEGIN> i’d rather have you without a farthing than katey keogh with her ass and garden . <END>
<BEGIN> poor old professor goodwin . <END>
<BEGIN> dreadful old case . <END>
<BEGIN> still he was a courteous old chap . <END>
<BEGIN> oldfashioned way he used to bow molly off the platform . <END>
<BEGIN> and the little mirror in his silk hat . <END>
<BEGIN> the night milly brought it into the parlour . <END>
<BEGIN> o , look what i found in professor goodwin’s hat ! <END>
<BEGIN> all we laughed . <END>
<BEGIN> sex breaking out even then . <END>
<BEGIN> pert little piece she was . <END>
<BEGIN> he prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over : then fitted the teapot on the tray . <END>
<BEGIN> its hump bumped as he took it up . <END>
<BEGIN> everything on it ? <END>
<BEGIN> bread and butter , four , sugar , spoon , her cream . <END>
<BEGIN> yes . <END>
<BEGIN> he carried it upstairs , his thumb hooked in the teapot handle . <END>
<BEGIN> nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead . <END>
<BEGIN> —what a time you were ! <END>
<BEGIN> she said . <END>
<BEGIN> she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow . <END>
<BEGIN> he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs , sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder . <END>
<BEGIN> the warmth of her couched body rose on the air , mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured . <END>
<BEGIN> a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow . <END>
<BEGIN> in the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread . <END>
<BEGIN> —who was the letter from ? <END>
<BEGIN> he asked . <END>
<BEGIN> bold hand . <END>
<BEGIN> marion . <END>
<BEGIN> —o , boylan , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> he’s bringing the programme . <END>
<BEGIN> —what are you singing ? <END>
<BEGIN> — _ là ci darem _ with j . c . doyle , she said , and _ love’s old sweet song <END>
<BEGIN> her full lips , drinking , smiled . <END>
<BEGIN> rather stale smell that incense leaves next day . <END>
<BEGIN> like foul flowerwater . <END>
<BEGIN> —would you like the window open a little ? <END>
<BEGIN> she doubled a slice of bread into her mouth , asking : —what time is the funeral ? <END>
<BEGIN> —eleven , i think , he answered . <END>
<BEGIN> i didn’t see the paper . <END>
<BEGIN> following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed . <END>
<BEGIN> no ? <END>
<BEGIN> then , a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking : rumpled , shiny sole . <END>
<BEGIN> —no : that book . <END>
<BEGIN> other stocking . <END>
<BEGIN> her petticoat . <END>
<BEGIN> —it must have fell down , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> he felt here and there . <END>
<BEGIN> _ voglio e non vorrei <END>
<BEGIN> wonder if she pronounces that right : _ voglio <END>
<BEGIN> not in the bed . <END>
<BEGIN> must have slid down . <END>
<BEGIN> he stooped and lifted the valance . <END>
<BEGIN> the book , fallen , sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot . <END>
<BEGIN> —show here , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> i put a mark in it . <END>
<BEGIN> there’s a word i wanted to ask you . <END>
<BEGIN> she swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and , having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket , began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word . <END>
<BEGIN> —met him what ? <END>
<BEGIN> he asked . <END>
<BEGIN> —here , she said . <END>
<BEGIN> what does that mean ? <END>
<BEGIN> he leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail . <END>
<BEGIN> —metempsychosis ? <END>
<BEGIN> —yes . <END>
<BEGIN> who’s he when he’s at home ? <END>
<BEGIN> —metempsychosis , he said , frowning . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s greek : from the greek . <END>
<BEGIN> that means the transmigration of souls . <END>
<BEGIN> —o , rocks ! <END>
<BEGIN> she said . <END>
<BEGIN> tell us in plain words . <END>
<BEGIN> he smiled , glancing askance at her mocking eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> the same young eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> the first night after the charades . <END>
<BEGIN> dolphin’s barn . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned over the smudged pages . <END>
<BEGIN> _ ruby : the pride of the ring <END>

<BEGIN> better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral . <END>
<BEGIN> he went in , bowing his head under the low lintel . <END>
<BEGIN> leaving the door ajar , amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces . <END>

<BEGIN> day : then the night . <END>
<BEGIN> he tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it . <END>
<BEGIN> then he girded up his trousers , braced and buttoned himself . <END>
<BEGIN> he pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air . <END>
<BEGIN> in the bright light , lightened and cooled in limb , he eyed carefully his black trousers : the ends , the knees , the houghs of the knees . <END>
<BEGIN> what time is the funeral ? <END>

<BEGIN> must get some from tom kernan . <END>
<BEGIN> couldn’t ask him at a funeral , though . <END>
<BEGIN> while his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair . <END>
<BEGIN> very warm morning . <END>
<BEGIN> under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha . <END>
<BEGIN> just there . <END>
<BEGIN> his right hand came down into the bowl of his hat . <END>
<BEGIN> his fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket . <END>
<BEGIN> so warm . <END>

<BEGIN> no answer probably . <END>

<BEGIN> mr bloom entered and sat in the vacant place . <END>

<BEGIN> other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind . <END>
<BEGIN> the blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker , door ajar . <END>
<BEGIN> at walking pace . <END>
<BEGIN> they waited still , their knees jogging , till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks . <END>

<BEGIN> quicker . <END>
<BEGIN> the wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes . <END>

<BEGIN> mr dedalus nodded , looking out . <END>

<BEGIN> all watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers . <END>

<BEGIN> the carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past watery lane . <END>

<BEGIN> —there’s a friend of yours gone by , dedalus , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> —who is that ? <END>
<BEGIN> —your son and heir . <END>
<BEGIN> —where is he ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr dedalus said , stretching over across . <END>
<BEGIN> the carriage , passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses , lurched round the corner and , swerving back to the tramtrack , rolled on noisily with chattering wheels . <END>
<BEGIN> mr dedalus fell back , saying : —was that mulligan cad with him ? <END>
<BEGIN> his _ fidus achates <END>
<BEGIN> —no , mr bloom said . <END>
<BEGIN> he was alone . <END>
<BEGIN> —down with his aunt sally , i suppose , mr dedalus said , the goulding faction , the drunken little costdrawer and crissie , papa’s little lump of dung , the wise child that knows her own father . <END>

<BEGIN> that mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts . <END>
<BEGIN> his name stinks all over dublin . <END>
<BEGIN> but with the help of god and his blessed mother i’ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate . <END>
<BEGIN> i’ll tickle his catastrophe , believe you me . <END>

<BEGIN> —in all his pristine beauty , mr power said . <END>
<BEGIN> mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly : —the devil break the hasp of your back ! <END>
<BEGIN> mr power , collapsing in laughter , shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed gray’s statue . <END>
<BEGIN> —we have all been there , martin cunningham said broadly . <END>

<BEGIN> isn’t it awfully good ? <END>
<BEGIN> —what is that ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr dedalus asked . <END>
<BEGIN> i didn’t hear it . <END>
<BEGIN> —there was a girl in the case , mr bloom began , and he determined to send him to the isle of man out of harm’s way but when they were <URL> —what ? <END>

<BEGIN> i wish to christ he did ! <END>
<BEGIN> mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils . <END>
<BEGIN> —no , mr bloom said , the son <URL> martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely : —reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the liffey . <END>
<BEGIN> —for god’s sake ! <END>
<BEGIN> mr dedalus exclaimed in fright . <END>
<BEGIN> is he dead ? <END>
<BEGIN> —dead ! <END>
<BEGIN> martin cunningham cried . <END>
<BEGIN> not he ! <END>
<BEGIN> a boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive . <END>
<BEGIN> half the town was there . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , mr bloom said . <END>
<BEGIN> but the funny part <URL> —and reuben j , martin cunningham said , gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life . <END>
<BEGIN> a stifled sigh came from under mr power’s hand . <END>
<BEGIN> —o , he did , martin cunningham affirmed . <END>
<BEGIN> like a hero . <END>
<BEGIN> a silver florin . <END>
<BEGIN> —isn’t it awfully good ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom said eagerly . <END>
<BEGIN> —one and eightpence too much , mr dedalus said drily . <END>

<BEGIN> —eight plums a penny ! <END>
<BEGIN> eight for a penny ! <END>
<BEGIN> —we had better look a little serious , martin cunningham said . <END>
<BEGIN> mr dedalus sighed . <END>
<BEGIN> —ah then indeed , he said , poor little paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh . <END>
<BEGIN> many a good one he told himself . <END>
<BEGIN> —the lord forgive me ! <END>
<BEGIN> mr power said , wiping his wet eyes with his fingers . <END>
<BEGIN> poor paddy ! <END>
<BEGIN> i little thought a week ago when i saw him last and he was in his usual health that i’d be driving after him like this . <END>
<BEGIN> he’s gone from us . <END>

<BEGIN> mr power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension . <END>
<BEGIN> —he had a sudden death , poor fellow , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> —the best death , mr bloom said . <END>
<BEGIN> their wide open eyes looked at him . <END>
<BEGIN> —no suffering , he said . <END>

<BEGIN> martin cunningham drew out his watch briskly , coughed and put it back . <END>
<BEGIN> —the greatest disgrace to have in the family , mr power added . <END>
<BEGIN> —temporary insanity , of course , martin cunningham said decisively . <END>
<BEGIN> we must take a charitable view of it . <END>

<BEGIN> he stepped aside nimbly . <END>
<BEGIN> clay , brown , damp , began to be seen in the hole . <END>
<BEGIN> it rose . <END>
<BEGIN> nearly over . <END>
<BEGIN> a mound of damp clods rose more , rose , and the gravediggers rested their spades . <END>
<BEGIN> all uncovered again for a few instants . <END>
<BEGIN> the boy propped his wreath against a corner : the brother in - law his on a lump . <END>
<BEGIN> the gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow . <END>
<BEGIN> then knocked the blades lightly on the turf : clean . <END>
<BEGIN> one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass . <END>
<BEGIN> one , leaving his mates , walked slowly on with shouldered weapon , its blade blueglancing . <END>
<BEGIN> silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband . <END>

<BEGIN> the mourners moved away slowly without aim , by devious paths , staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb . <END>
<BEGIN> —let us go round by the chief’s grave , hynes said . <END>
<BEGIN> we have time . <END>
<BEGIN> —let us , mr power said . <END>
<BEGIN> they turned to the right , following their slow thoughts . <END>
<BEGIN> with awe mr power’s blank voice spoke : —some say he is not in that grave at all . <END>
<BEGIN> that the coffin was filled with stones . <END>
<BEGIN> that one day he will come again . <END>
<BEGIN> hynes shook his head . <END>
<BEGIN> —parnell will never come again , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> he’s there , all that was mortal of him . <END>
<BEGIN> peace to his ashes . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels , crosses , broken pillars , family vaults , stone hopes praying with upcast eyes , old ireland’s hearts and hands . <END>

<BEGIN> in america those things were continually happening . <END>
<BEGIN> unfortunate people to die like that , unprepared . <END>
<BEGIN> still , an act of perfect contrition . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee went by daniel bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged . <END>
<BEGIN> they saluted him and were saluted . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee passed h . j . o’neill’s funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay . <END>
<BEGIN> a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable . <END>
<BEGIN> in youkstetter’s , the porkbutcher’s , father conmee observed pig’s puddings , white and black and red , lie neatly curled in tubes . <END>
<BEGIN> moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge , a towhorse with pendent head , a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships , smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him . <END>
<BEGIN> it was idyllic : and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people . <END>
<BEGIN> on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s . j . of saint francis xavier’s church , upper gardiner street , stepped on to an outward bound tram . <END>
<BEGIN> off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c . c . of saint agatha’s church , north william street , on to newcomen bridge . <END>
<BEGIN> at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar , a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove , while four shillings , a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse . <END>
<BEGIN> passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket . <END>
<BEGIN> the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee liked cheerful decorum . <END>
<BEGIN> it was a peaceful day . <END>
<BEGIN> the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down . <END>
<BEGIN> his wife , father conmee supposed . <END>
<BEGIN> a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses . <END>
<BEGIN> she raised her small gloved fist , yawned ever so gently , tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily , sweetly . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee perceived her perfume in the car . <END>
<BEGIN> he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head . <END>
<BEGIN> at annesley bridge the tram halted and , when it was about to go , an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight . <END>
<BEGIN> the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her . <END>
<BEGIN> she passed out with her basket and a marketnet : and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down : and father conmee thought that , as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare , she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _ bless you , my child that they have been absolved , _ pray for <URL> but they had so many worries in life , so many cares , poor creatures . <END>
<BEGIN> from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s . j . and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night . <END>
<BEGIN> that book by the belgian jesuit , _ le nombre des élus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea . <END>
<BEGIN> those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> been brought . <END>
<BEGIN> but they were god’s souls , created by god . <END>
<BEGIN> it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost , a waste , if one might say . <END>
<BEGIN> at the howth road stop father conmee alighted , was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn . <END>
<BEGIN> the malahide road was quiet . <END>
<BEGIN> it pleased father conmee , road and name . <END>

<BEGIN> lord talbot de malahide , immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining . <END>
<BEGIN> then came the call to arms and she was maid , wife and widow in one day . <END>
<BEGIN> those were old worldish days , loyal times in joyous townlands , old times in the barony . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee , walking , thought of his little book _ old times in the barony _ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort , daughter of lord molesworth , first countess of belvedere . <END>
<BEGIN> a listless lady , no more young , walked alone the shore of lough ennel , mary , first countess of belvedere , listlessly walking in the evening , not startled when an otter plunged . <END>
<BEGIN> who could know the truth ? <END>
<BEGIN> not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully , _ eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husband’s brother ? <END>
<BEGIN> she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did . <END>
<BEGIN> only god knew and she and he , her husband’s brother . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence , needed however for man’s race on earth , and of the ways of god which were not our ways . <END>
<BEGIN> don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore . <END>
<BEGIN> he was humane and honoured there . <END>
<BEGIN> he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom , ceiled with full fruit clusters . <END>
<BEGIN> and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom , noble to noble , were impalmed by don john conmee . <END>
<BEGIN> it was a charming day . <END>
<BEGIN> the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages , curtseying to him with ample underleaves . <END>
<BEGIN> the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind . <END>
<BEGIN> _ moutonner the french said . <END>
<BEGIN> a just and homely word . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee , reading his office , watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey . <END>
<BEGIN> his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field . <END>
<BEGIN> he walked there , reading in the evening , and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play , young cries in the quiet evening . <END>
<BEGIN> he was their rector : his reign was mild . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out . <END>
<BEGIN> an ivory bookmark told him the page . <END>
<BEGIN> nones . <END>
<BEGIN> he should have read that before lunch . <END>
<BEGIN> but lady maxwell had come . <END>
<BEGIN> father conmee read in secret _ pater _ and _ ave _ and crossed his breast . <END>

<BEGIN> lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots , silvery fishes , crans of herrings , drafts of eels , codlings , creels of fingerlings , purple seagems and playful insects . <END>
<BEGIN> and heroes voyage from afar to woo them , from eblana to slievemargy , the peerless princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruachan’s land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle , princes , the sons of kings . <END>

<BEGIN> i dare him , says he , and i doubledare him . <END>
<BEGIN> come out here , geraghty , you notorious bloody hill and dale robber ! <END>
<BEGIN> and by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves : and there is ever heard a trampling , cackling , roaring , lowing , bleating , bellowing , rumbling , grunting , champing , chewing , of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy vales of thomond , from the m’gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly shannon the unfathomable , and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of kiar , their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds , various in size , the agate with this dun . <END>
<BEGIN> so we turned into barney kiernan’s and there , sure enough , was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel , garryowen , and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink . <END>

<BEGIN> —that’s all right , citizen , says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> friends here . <END>
<BEGIN> —pass , friends , says he . <END>
<BEGIN> then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he : —what’s your opinion of the times ? <END>
<BEGIN> doing the rapparee and rory of the hill . <END>
<BEGIN> but , begob , joe was equal to the occasion . <END>
<BEGIN> —i think the markets are on a rise , says he , sliding his hand down his fork . <END>
<BEGIN> so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says : —foreign wars is the cause of it . <END>
<BEGIN> and says joe , sticking his thumb in his pocket : —it’s the russians wish to tyrannise . <END>
<BEGIN> —arrah , give over your bloody codding , joe , says i . i’ve a thirst on me i wouldn’t sell for half a crown . <END>

<BEGIN> the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower . <END>
<BEGIN> a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground , the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble . <END>
<BEGIN> he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes . <END>
<BEGIN> beneath this he wore trews of deerskin , roughly stitched with gut . <END>

<BEGIN> a couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber , a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone . <END>
<BEGIN> so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid . <END>

<BEGIN> rumbold , master <URL> —and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too , says the citizen . <END>
<BEGIN> —and the dirty scrawl of the wretch , says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> here , says he , take them to hell out of my sight , alf . <END>
<BEGIN> hello , bloom , says he , what will you have ? <END>
<BEGIN> so they started arguing about the point , bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar . <END>
<BEGIN> gob , he’s a prudent member and no mistake . <END>
<BEGIN> —give us one of your prime stinkers , terry , says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it . <END>
<BEGIN> —they’re all barbers , says he , from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses . <END>
<BEGIN> and he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull . <END>
<BEGIN> in the dark land they bide , the vengeful knights of the razor . <END>
<BEGIN> their deadly coil they grasp : yea , and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord . <END>
<BEGIN> so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on . <END>
<BEGIN> —there’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on , says alf . <END>
<BEGIN> —what’s that ? <END>
<BEGIN> says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> —the poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged , says alf . <END>
<BEGIN> —that so ? <END>
<BEGIN> says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> —god’s truth , says alf . <END>
<BEGIN> i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady , the invincible . <END>
<BEGIN> he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker . <END>
<BEGIN> —ruling passion strong in death , says joe , as someone said . <END>
<BEGIN> —that can be explained by science , says bloom . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s only a natural phenomenon , don’t you see , because on account of <URL> and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon . <END>
<BEGIN> the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would , according to the best approved tradition of medical science , be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus , thereby causing the elastic pores of the _ corpora cavernosa _ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _ in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged , drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this , that and the other . <END>
<BEGIN> talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought . <END>
<BEGIN> mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs . <END>
<BEGIN> and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get . <END>
<BEGIN> so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him : —give us the paw ! <END>
<BEGIN> give the paw , doggy ! <END>
<BEGIN> good old doggy ! <END>
<BEGIN> give the paw here ! <END>
<BEGIN> give us the paw ! <END>
<BEGIN> arrah , bloody end to the paw he’d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog : give you the bloody pip . <END>
<BEGIN> then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs’ tin he told terry to bring . <END>
<BEGIN> gob , he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more . <END>
<BEGIN> near ate the tin and all , hungry bloody mongrel . <END>
<BEGIN> and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point , the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country , the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she’s far from the land . <END>
<BEGIN> and bloom , of course , with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face . <END>
<BEGIN> phenomenon ! <END>
<BEGIN> the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley . <END>
<BEGIN> time they were stopping up in the _ city arms _ pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk . <END>
<BEGIN> and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and , by the holy farmer , he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings , if the three women didn’t near roast him , it’s a queer story , the old one , bloom’s wife and mrs o’dowd that kept the hotel . <END>
<BEGIN> jesus , i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat . <END>
<BEGIN> and bloom with his _ but don’t you see and _ but on the other hand <END>
<BEGIN> and sure , more be token , the lout i’m told was in power’s after , the blender’s , round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment . <END>
<BEGIN> phenomenon ! <END>
<BEGIN> —the memory of the dead , says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom . <END>
<BEGIN> —ay , ay , says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> —you don’t grasp my point , says bloom . <END>
<BEGIN> what i mean <URL> — _ sinn fein says the citizen . <END>
<BEGIN> _ sinn fein amhain the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us . <END>
<BEGIN> the last farewell was affecting in the extreme . <END>
<BEGIN> from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance . <END>
<BEGIN> the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle . <END>
<BEGIN> a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons . <END>
<BEGIN> a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza’s plaintive muse . <END>
<BEGIN> special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents . <END>
<BEGIN> considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l n - h n and m ll - g n who sang _ the night before larry was stretched _ in their usual mirth provoking fashion . <END>
<BEGIN> our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies . <END>
<BEGIN> the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat . <END>
<BEGIN> the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite . <END>
<BEGIN> the delegation , present in full force , consisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone ( the semiparalysed _ doyen _ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane monsieur pierrepaul petitépatant , the grandjoker vladinmire pokethankertscheff , the archjoker leopold rudolph von schwanzenbad hodenthaler , countess marha virága kisászony putrápesthi , hiram y . bomboost , count athanatos karamelopulos , ali baba backsheesh rahat lokum effendi , señor hidalgo caballero don pecadillo y palabras y paternoster de la malora de la malaria , hokopoko harakiri , hi hung chang , olaf kobberkeddelsen , mynheer trik van trumps , pan poleaxe paddyrisky , goosepond prhklstr kratchinabritchisitch , borus hupinkoff , herr hurhausdirektorpresident hans chuechli steuerli , nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor kriegfried ueberallgemein . <END>
<BEGIN> all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness . <END>
<BEGIN> an animated altercation ( in which all took part ) ensued among the f . o . t . e . i . as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland’s patron saint . <END>
<BEGIN> in the course of the argument cannonballs , scimitars , boomerangs , blunderbusses , stinkpots , meatchoppers , umbrellas , catapults , knuckledusters , sandbags , lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged . <END>
<BEGIN> the baby policeman , constable macfadden , summoned by special courier from booterstown , quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties . <END>
<BEGIN> the readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted . <END>
<BEGIN> constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the f . o . t . e . <URL> several of whom were bleeding profusely . <END>
<BEGIN> commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair , it was explained by his legal adviser avvocato pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses . <END>
<BEGIN> the objects ( which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches ) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme . <END>
<BEGIN> quietly , unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower , the _ gladiolus cruentus <END>
<BEGIN> he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough which so many have tried ( unsuccessfully ) to imitate—short , painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man . <END>
<BEGIN> the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse , the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries , _ hoch , banzai , eljen , zivio , chinchin , polla kronia , hiphip , vive , allah amid which the ringing _ evviva _ of the delegate of the land of song ( a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers ) was easily distinguishable . <END>
<BEGIN> it was exactly seventeen o’clock . <END>
<BEGIN> the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared , the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero , which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi , being removed by his medical adviser in attendance , dr pippi . <END>
<BEGIN> the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater , his cassock above his hoary head , and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication . <END>
<BEGIN> hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner , his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously . <END>
<BEGIN> as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office . <END>
<BEGIN> on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife , the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances ( specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers , messrs john round and sons , sheffield a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum , colon , blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim . <END>
<BEGIN> the housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution . <END>
<BEGIN> quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs , fried steak and onions , done to a nicety , delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he , with an abnegation rare in these our times , rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish ( immediately acceded to ) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem . <END>
<BEGIN> the _ nec _ and _ non plus ultra _ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake . <END>
<BEGIN> the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _ sheila , my own <END>
<BEGIN> encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach . <END>
<BEGIN> she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory , that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park . <END>
<BEGIN> she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and , oblivious of the dreadful present , they both laughed heartily , all the spectators , including the venerable pastor , joining in the general merriment . <END>
<BEGIN> that monster audience simply rocked with delight . <END>
<BEGIN> but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time . <END>
<BEGIN> a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people , touched to the inmost core , broke into heartrending sobs , not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself . <END>
<BEGIN> big strong men , officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary , were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage . <END>
<BEGIN> a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate , noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex , stepped forward and , presenting his visiting card , bankbook and genealogical tree , solicited the hand of the hapless young lady , requesting her to name the day , and was accepted on the spot . <END>
<BEGIN> every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch , a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion : and when the gallant young oxonian ( the bearer , by the way , of one of the most timehonoured names in albion’s history ) placed on the finger of his blushing _ fiancée _ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds . <END>
<BEGIN> nay , even the stern provostmarshal , lieutenantcolonel tomkin maxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson , who presided on the sad occasion , he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching , could not now restrain his natural emotion . <END>
<BEGIN> with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard , by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _ entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone : —god blimey if she aint a clinker , that there bleeding tart . <END>
<BEGIN> blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry , straight , it does , when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down limehouse way . <END>
<BEGIN> so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink , the curse of ireland . <END>
<BEGIN> antitreating is about the size of it . <END>
<BEGIN> gob , he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint . <END>
<BEGIN> and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings , song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns , gob , flahoolagh entertainment , don’t be talking . <END>
<BEGIN> ireland sober is ireland free . <END>
<BEGIN> and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of . <END>
<BEGIN> and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females , hitting below the belt . <END>
<BEGIN> so howandever , as i was saying , the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me . <END>
<BEGIN> i’d train him by kindness , so i would , if he was my dog . <END>
<BEGIN> give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him . <END>
<BEGIN> —afraid he’ll bite you ? <END>
<BEGIN> says the citizen , jeering . <END>
<BEGIN> —no , says i . <END>
<BEGIN> but he might take my leg for a lamppost . <END>
<BEGIN> so he calls the old dog over . <END>
<BEGIN> —what’s on you , garry ? <END>
<BEGIN> says he . <END>
<BEGIN> then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling , letting on to answer , like a duet in the opera . <END>
<BEGIN> such growling you never heard as they let off between them . <END>
<BEGIN> someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _ pro bono publico _ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that . <END>
<BEGIN> growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws . <END>
<BEGIN> all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals ( and their name is legion ) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _ sobriquet _ of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry . <END>
<BEGIN> the exhibition , which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system , comprises , among other achievements , the recitation of verse . <END>
<BEGIN> our greatest living phonetic expert ( wild horses shall not drag it from us <END>
<BEGIN> has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _ striking _ resemblance ( the italics are ours ) to the ranns of ancient celtic bards . <END>
<BEGIN> we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather ( as a contributor d . o . c . points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary ) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye . <END>
<BEGIN> we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication . <END>
<BEGIN> the metrical system of the canine original , which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn , is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught . <END>
<BEGIN> perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour . <END>
<BEGIN> the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you , barney kiernan , has no sup of water to cool my courage , and my guts red roaring after lowry’s lights . <END>
<BEGIN> so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and , gob , you could hear him lapping it up a mile off . <END>
<BEGIN> and joe asked him would he have another . <END>
<BEGIN> —i will , says he , _ a chara to show there’s no ill feeling . <END>
<BEGIN> gob , he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking . <END>
<BEGIN> arsing around from one pub to another , leaving it to your own honour , with old giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators . <END>
<BEGIN> entertainment for man and beast . <END>
<BEGIN> and says joe : —could you make a hole in another pint ? <END>
<BEGIN> —could a swim duck ? <END>
<BEGIN> says i . <END>
<BEGIN> —same again , terry , says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment ? <END>
<BEGIN> says he . <END>
<BEGIN> —thank you , no , says bloom . <END>
<BEGIN> as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham , don’t you see , about this insurance of poor dignam’s . <END>
<BEGIN> martin asked me to go to the house . <END>
<BEGIN> you see , he , dignam , i mean , didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy . <END>
<BEGIN> —holy wars , says joe , laughing , that’s a good one if old shylock is landed . <END>
<BEGIN> so the wife comes out top dog , what ? <END>
<BEGIN> —well , that’s a point , says bloom , for the wife’s admirers . <END>
<BEGIN> —whose admirers ? <END>
<BEGIN> says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> —the wife’s advisers , i mean , says bloom . <END>
<BEGIN> then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act . <END>
<BEGIN> he was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court . <END>
<BEGIN> selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery . <END>
<BEGIN> true as you’re there . <END>
<BEGIN> o , commend me to an israelite ! <END>
<BEGIN> royal and privileged hungarian robbery . <END>
<BEGIN> so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer , a finer than poor little willy that’s dead to tell her . <END>
<BEGIN> choking with bloody foolery . <END>
<BEGIN> and shaking bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that . <END>
<BEGIN> shake hands , brother . <END>
<BEGIN> you’re a rogue and i’m another . <END>
<BEGIN> —let me , said he , so far presume upon our acquaintance which , however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time , is founded , as i hope and believe , on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour . <END>
<BEGIN> but , should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness . <END>
<BEGIN> —no , rejoined the other , i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that , though the errand be one of sorrow , this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup . <END>
<BEGIN> —then suffer me to take your hand , said he . <END>
<BEGIN> the goodness of your heart , i feel sure , will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy , were i to give vent to my feelings , would deprive me even of speech . <END>
<BEGIN> and off with him and out trying to walk straight . <END>
<BEGIN> boosed at five o’clock . <END>
<BEGIN> night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby , 14a . <END>
<BEGIN> blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time , fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard , drinking porter out of teacups . <END>
<BEGIN> and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls , joseph manuo , and talking against the catholic religion , and he serving mass in adam and eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut , who wrote the new testament , and the old testament , and hugging and smugging . <END>
<BEGIN> and the two shawls killed with the laughing , picking his pockets , the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another . <END>
<BEGIN> _ how is your testament ? <END>
<BEGIN> have you got an old testament only paddy was passing there , i tell you what . <END>
<BEGIN> then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife , and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her , no less , and her violets , nice as pie , doing the little lady . <END>
<BEGIN> jack mooney’s sister . <END>
<BEGIN> and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples . <END>
<BEGIN> gob , jack made him toe the line . <END>
<BEGIN> told him if he didn’t patch up the pot , jesus , he’d kick the shite out of him . <END>
<BEGIN> so terry brought the three pints . <END>
<BEGIN> —here , says joe , doing the honours . <END>
<BEGIN> here , citizen . <END>
<BEGIN> — _ slan leat says he . <END>
<BEGIN> —fortune , joe , says i . <END>
<BEGIN> good health , citizen . <END>
<BEGIN> gob , he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already . <END>
<BEGIN> want a small fortune to keep him in drinks . <END>
<BEGIN> —who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty , alf ? <END>
<BEGIN> says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> —friend of yours , says alf . <END>
<BEGIN> —nannan ? <END>
<BEGIN> says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> the mimber ? <END>
<BEGIN> —i won’t mention any names , says alf . <END>
<BEGIN> —i thought so , says joe . <END>
<BEGIN> i saw him up at that meeting now with william field , m . <URL> the cattle traders . <END>
<BEGIN> —hairy iopas , says the citizen , that exploded volcano , the darling of all countries and the idol of his own . <END>
<BEGIN> so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue . <END>
<BEGIN> because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard . <END>
<BEGIN> walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier . <END>
<BEGIN> mister knowall . <END>
<BEGIN> teach your grandmother how to milk ducks . <END>
<BEGIN> pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs o’dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her . <END>
<BEGIN> couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it . <END>
<BEGIN> what’s your programme today ? <END>
<BEGIN> ay . <END>
<BEGIN> humane methods . <END>
<BEGIN> because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently . <END>
<BEGIN> gob , he’d have a soft hand under a hen . <END>
<BEGIN> ga ga gara . <END>

<BEGIN> the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace . <END>
<BEGIN> far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand , on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay , on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and , last but not least , on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man , mary , star of the sea . <END>

<BEGIN> many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine , cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey , two little curlyheaded boys , dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _ h . <END>
<BEGIN> m . s . belleisle _ printed on both . <END>
<BEGIN> for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins , scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them . <END>
<BEGIN> they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets , building castles as children do , or playing with their big coloured ball , happy as the day was long . <END>
<BEGIN> and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight . <END>
<BEGIN> he was but eleven months and nine days old and , though still a tiny toddler , was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words . <END>
<BEGIN> cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin . <END>
<BEGIN> —now , baby , cissy caffrey said . <END>
<BEGIN> say out big , big . <END>
<BEGIN> i want a drink of water . <END>
<BEGIN> and baby prattled after her : —a jink a jink a jawbo . <END>
<BEGIN> cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children , so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on . <END>
<BEGIN> what a persuasive power that girl had ! <END>
<BEGIN> but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold , a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib . <END>
<BEGIN> none of your spoilt beauties , flora macflimsy sort , was cissy caffrey . <END>
<BEGIN> a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life , always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips , a girl lovable in the extreme . <END>
<BEGIN> and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother . <END>
<BEGIN> but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky . <END>
<BEGIN> boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule . <END>
<BEGIN> the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had . <END>
<BEGIN> but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and , true to the maxim that every little irishman’s house is his castle , he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and ( alas to relate <END>
<BEGIN> the coveted castle too . <END>
<BEGIN> needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends . <END>
<BEGIN> —come here , tommy , his sister called imperatively . <END>
<BEGIN> at once ! <END>
<BEGIN> and you , jacky , for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand . <END>
<BEGIN> wait till i catch you for that . <END>
<BEGIN> his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins . <END>
<BEGIN> and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure . <END>
<BEGIN> his little man o’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit . <END>
<BEGIN> still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him , her eyes dancing in admonition . <END>
<BEGIN> —nasty bold jacky ! <END>
<BEGIN> she cried . <END>
<BEGIN> she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly : —what’s your name ? <END>

<BEGIN> cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes . <END>
<BEGIN> but who was gerty ? <END>
<BEGIN> gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions , lost in thought , gazing far away into the distance was , in very truth , as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see . <END>
<BEGIN> she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though , as folks often said , she was more a giltrap than a macdowell . <END>
<BEGIN> her figure was slight and graceful , inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling . <END>
<BEGIN> the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupid’s bow , greekly perfect . <END>
<BEGIN> her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either . <END>
<BEGIN> bertha supple told that once to edy boardman , a deliberate lie , when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty ( the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals ) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again . <END>
<BEGIN> no . <END>
<BEGIN> honour where honour is due . <END>
<BEGIN> there was an innate refinement , a languid queenly _ hauteur _ about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep . <END>
<BEGIN> had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her . <END>
<BEGIN> mayhap it was this , the love that might have been , that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look , tense with suppressed meaning , that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes , a charm few could resist . <END>
<BEGIN> why have women such eyes of witchery ? <END>
<BEGIN> gerty’s were of the bluest irish blue , set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows . <END>
<BEGIN> time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive . <END>
<BEGIN> it was madame vera verity , directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette , who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes , so becoming in leaders of fashion , and she had never regretted it . <END>
<BEGIN> then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose ? <END>
<BEGIN> that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one . <END>
<BEGIN> but gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair . <END>
<BEGIN> it was dark brown with a natural wave in it . <END>
<BEGIN> she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too , thursday for wealth . <END>
<BEGIN> and just now at edy’s words as a telltale flush , delicate as the faintest rosebloom , crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god’s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal . <END>
<BEGIN> for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue . <END>
<BEGIN> inclination prompted her to speak out : dignity told her to be silent . <END>
<BEGIN> the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning . <END>
<BEGIN> she knew right well , no one better , what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel . <END>
<BEGIN> as per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window . <END>
<BEGIN> only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w . e . wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university . <END>
<BEGIN> little recked he perhaps for what she felt , that dull aching void in her heart sometimes , piercing to the core . <END>
<BEGIN> yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time . <END>
<BEGIN> they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph . <END>
<BEGIN> but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked , every inch a gentleman , the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out . <END>
<BEGIN> a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes ( because it was expected in the _ lady’s pictorial _ that electric blue would be worn ) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket ( in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit ) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection . <END>
<BEGIN> she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone . <END>
<BEGIN> all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery’s summer sales , the very it , slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice , seven fingers two and a penny . <END>
<BEGIN> she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then , smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her ! <END>
<BEGIN> and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew . <END>
<BEGIN> her shoes were the newest thing in footwear ( edy boardman prided herself that she was very _ petite _ but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell , a five , and never would ash , oak or elm ) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep . <END>
<BEGIN> her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops . <END>
<BEGIN> as for undies they were gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen ( though gerty would never see seventeen again ) can find it in his heart to blame her ? <END>
<BEGIN> she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery , three garments and nighties extra , and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons , rosepink , pale blue , mauve and peagreen , and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things . <END>
<BEGIN> she was wearing the blue for luck , hoping against hope , her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a friday . <END>
<BEGIN> and yet and yet ! <END>
<BEGIN> that strained look on her face ! <END>
<BEGIN> a gnawing sorrow is there all the time . <END>
<BEGIN> her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where , giving way to tears , she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror . <END>
<BEGIN> you are lovely , gerty , it said . <END>
<BEGIN> the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty macdowell yearns in vain . <END>
<BEGIN> yes , she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t . c . d . ( because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie ) and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be . <END>
<BEGIN> he was too young to understand . <END>
<BEGIN> he would not believe in love , a woman’s birthright . <END>
<BEGIN> the night of the party long ago in stoer’s ( he was still in short trousers ) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips . <END>
<BEGIN> he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss ( the first <END>
<BEGIN> but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments . <END>
<BEGIN> impetuous fellow ! <END>
<BEGIN> strength of character had never been reggy wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men . <END>
<BEGIN> but waiting , always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over . <END>
<BEGIN> no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal , perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey , and who would understand , take her in his sheltering arms , strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss . <END>
<BEGIN> it would be like heaven . <END>
<BEGIN> for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve . <END>
<BEGIN> with all the heart of her she longs to be his only , his affianced bride for riches for poor , in sickness in health , till death us two part , from this to this day forward . <END>
<BEGIN> and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be . <END>
<BEGIN> then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face , bertha supple too , and edy , little spitfire , because she would be twentytwo in november . <END>
<BEGIN> she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess . <END>
<BEGIN> her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire , dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction , then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltrap’s lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses . <END>
<BEGIN> he would be tall with broad shoulders ( she had always admired tall men for a husband ) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon ( three wonderful weeks <END>
<BEGIN> and then , when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house , every morning they would both have brekky , simple but perfectly served , for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight . <END>
<BEGIN> but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground , if you please . <END>
<BEGIN> the temper of him ! <END>
<BEGIN> o , he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies . <END>
<BEGIN> edy told him no , no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him . <END>
<BEGIN> —you’re not my sister , naughty tommy said . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s my ball . <END>
<BEGIN> but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up , look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career , having won the day . <END>
<BEGIN> —anything for a quiet life , laughed ciss . <END>
<BEGIN> and she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor , here’s his two horses , here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in , chinchopper , chinchopper , chinchopper chin . <END>
<BEGIN> but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him . <END>
<BEGIN> —i’d like to give him something , she said , so i would , where i won’t say . <END>
<BEGIN> —on the beeoteetom , laughed cissy merrily . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say , flushing a deep rosy red , and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said . <END>
<BEGIN> but not a pin cared ciss . <END>
<BEGIN> —let him ! <END>
<BEGIN> she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose . <END>
<BEGIN> give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at him . <END>
<BEGIN> madcap ciss with her golliwog curls . <END>
<BEGIN> you had to laugh at her sometimes . <END>
<BEGIN> for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white . <END>
<BEGIN> that was just like cissycums . <END>
<BEGIN> o , and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road , smoking a cigarette . <END>
<BEGIN> there was none to come up to her for fun . <END>
<BEGIN> but she was sincerity itself , one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made , not one of your twofaced things , too sweet to be wholesome . <END>
<BEGIN> and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ . <END>
<BEGIN> it was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner , the reverend john hughes s . <URL> rosary , sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament . <END>
<BEGIN> they were there gathered together without distinction of social class ( and a most edifying spectacle it was to see ) in that simple fane beside the waves , after the storms of this weary world , kneeling before the feet of the immaculate , reciting the litany of our lady of loreto , beseeching her to intercede for them , the old familiar words , holy mary , holy virgin of virgins . <END>
<BEGIN> how sad to poor gerty’s ears ! <END>
<BEGIN> had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink , by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearson’s weekly , she might now be rolling in her carriage , second to none . <END>
<BEGIN> over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket , thinking . <END>
<BEGIN> but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days . <END>
<BEGIN> nay , she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father , a prey to the fumes of intoxication , forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness , deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low . <END>
<BEGIN> and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful , virgin most merciful . <END>
<BEGIN> and gerty , rapt in thought , scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk . <END>
<BEGIN> you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face ( it was a palpable case of doctor fell ) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose . <END>
<BEGIN> poor father ! <END>
<BEGIN> with all his faults she loved him still when he sang _ tell me , mary , how to woo thee _ or _ my love and cottage near rochelle _ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _ the moon hath raised _ with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried , god have mercy on him , from a stroke . <END>
<BEGIN> her mother’s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken . <END>
<BEGIN> no one would have thought the end was so near . <END>
<BEGIN> now he was laid to rest . <END>
<BEGIN> and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino , artistic , standard designs , fit for a palace , gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home . <END>
<BEGIN> a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house , a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold . <END>
<BEGIN> and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about , taking snuff . <END>
<BEGIN> everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways . <END>
<BEGIN> it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac , the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window . <END>
<BEGIN> you could see there was a story behind it . <END>
<BEGIN> the colours were done something lovely . <END>
<BEGIN> she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat . <END>
<BEGIN> she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant . <END>
<BEGIN> the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks . <END>
<BEGIN> needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball . <END>
<BEGIN> our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please . <END>
<BEGIN> the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock . <END>
<BEGIN> the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed . <END>
<BEGIN> —if you fail try again , edy boardman said . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty smiled assent and bit her lip . <END>
<BEGIN> a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle . <END>
<BEGIN> pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking . <END>
<BEGIN> she felt the warm flush , a danger signal always with gerty macdowell , surging and flaming into her cheeks . <END>
<BEGIN> till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight , wan and strangely drawn , seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen . <END>
<BEGIN> through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin , spiritual vessel , pray for us , honourable vessel , pray for us , vessel of singular devotion , pray for us , mystical rose . <END>
<BEGIN> and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered , their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary , the most pious virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her . <END>
<BEGIN> the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers . <END>
<BEGIN> cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee , clapping baby hands in air . <END>
<BEGIN> peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah ! <END>
<BEGIN> and , my word , didn’t the little chap enjoy that ! <END>
<BEGIN> and then she told him to say papa . <END>
<BEGIN> —say papa , baby . <END>
<BEGIN> say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa . and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health , a perfect little bunch of love , and he would certainly turn out to be something great , they said . <END>
<BEGIN> —haja ja ja haja . <END>
<BEGIN> cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out , holy saint denis , that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him . <END>
<BEGIN> of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it : —habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa . <END>
<BEGIN> and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks . <END>
<BEGIN> it was all no use soothering him with no , nono , baby , no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss , always readywitted , gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves , no hour to be out , and the little brats of twins . <END>
<BEGIN> she gazed out towards the distant sea . <END>
<BEGIN> it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out , the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft . <END>
<BEGIN> and while she gazed her heart went pitapat . <END>
<BEGIN> yes , it was her he was looking at , and there was meaning in his look . <END>
<BEGIN> his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through , read her very soul . <END>
<BEGIN> wonderful eyes they were , superbly expressive , but could you trust them ? <END>
<BEGIN> people were so queer . <END>
<BEGIN> she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner , the image of the photo she had of martin harvey , the matinee idol , only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _ retroussé _ from where he was sitting . <END>
<BEGIN> he was in deep mourning , she could see that , and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face . <END>
<BEGIN> she would have given worlds to know what it was . <END>
<BEGIN> he was looking up so intently , so still , and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down . <END>
<BEGIN> she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away . <END>
<BEGIN> here was that of which she had so often dreamed . <END>
<BEGIN> it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else . <END>
<BEGIN> the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him , her dreamhusband , because she knew on the instant it was him . <END>
<BEGIN> if he had suffered , more sinned against than sinning , or even , even , if he had been himself a sinner , a wicked man , she cared not . <END>
<BEGIN> even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her . <END>
<BEGIN> there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm . <END>
<BEGIN> she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known , those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all , to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her , make him forget the memory of the past . <END>
<BEGIN> then mayhap he would embrace her gently , like a real man , crushing her soft body to him , and love her , his ownest girlie , for herself alone . <END>
<BEGIN> refuge of sinners . <END>
<BEGIN> comfortress of the afflicted . <END>
<BEGIN> _ ora pro nobis <END>
<BEGIN> well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away : and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty could picture the whole scene in the church , the stained glass windows lighted up , the candles , the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin’s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o’hanlon at the altar , carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down . <END>
<BEGIN> he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic . <END>
<BEGIN> he told her that time when she told him about that in confession , crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see , not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws , he said , in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god , he said , and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word . <END>
<BEGIN> he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place . <END>
<BEGIN> the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it . <END>
<BEGIN> little monkeys common as ditchwater . <END>
<BEGIN> someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places , the both of them . <END>
<BEGIN> and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned . <END>
<BEGIN> —jacky ! <END>
<BEGIN> tommy ! <END>
<BEGIN> not they ! <END>
<BEGIN> what a great notion they had ! <END>
<BEGIN> so cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out . <END>
<BEGIN> she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him , tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it . <END>
<BEGIN> she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible . <END>
<BEGIN> it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble . <END>
<BEGIN> _ tableau that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness . <END>
<BEGIN> queen of angels , queen of patriarchs , queen of prophets , of all saints , they prayed , queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o’hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o’hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the _ tantum ergo _ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _ tantumer gosa cramen tum <END>
<BEGIN> three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrow’s of george’s street on the tuesday , no the monday before easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at , transparent , and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form ( the cheek of her <END>
<BEGIN> because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself . <END>
<BEGIN> cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier , a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision , in sooth , almost maddening in its sweetness . <END>
<BEGIN> you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that . <END>
<BEGIN> she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve . <END>
<BEGIN> she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey . <END>
<BEGIN> her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose . <END>
<BEGIN> edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty , half smiling , with her specs like an old maid , pretending to nurse the baby . <END>
<BEGIN> irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers . <END>
<BEGIN> and she said to gerty : —a penny for your thoughts . <END>
<BEGIN> —what ? <END>
<BEGIN> replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth . <END>
<BEGIN> i was only wondering was it late . <END>
<BEGIN> because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late . <END>
<BEGIN> and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy , as glib as you like , said it was half past kissing time , time to kiss again . <END>
<BEGIN> but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early . <END>
<BEGIN> —wait , said cissy , i’ll run ask my uncle peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum . <END>
<BEGIN> so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket , getting nervous , and beginning to play with his watchchain , looking up at the church . <END>
<BEGIN> passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself . <END>
<BEGIN> one moment he had been there , fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze , and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman , selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure . <END>
<BEGIN> cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch , listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set . <END>
<BEGIN> his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones . <END>
<BEGIN> cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order . <END>
<BEGIN> then they sang the second verse of the _ tantum ergo _ and canon o’hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time . <END>
<BEGIN> it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets . <END>
<BEGIN> she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon . <END>
<BEGIN> his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour , literally worshipping at her shrine . <END>
<BEGIN> if ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face . <END>
<BEGIN> it is for you , gertrude macdowell , and you know it . <END>
<BEGIN> edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _ panem de coelo praestitisti eis _ and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty winced sharply . <END>
<BEGIN> a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable . <END>
<BEGIN> it hurt—o yes , it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat , so slim , so flawless , so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of . <END>
<BEGIN> she had loved him better than he knew . <END>
<BEGIN> lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears . <END>
<BEGIN> their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see . <END>
<BEGIN> —o , responded gerty , quick as lightning , laughing , and the proud head flashed up . <END>
<BEGIN> i can throw my cap at who i like because it’s leap year . <END>
<BEGIN> her words rang out crystalclear , more musical than the cooing of the ringdove , but they cut the silence icily . <END>
<BEGIN> there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with . <END>
<BEGIN> as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces . <END>
<BEGIN> and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot . <END>
<BEGIN> miss puny little edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it , the little kinnatt , because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof , apart , in another sphere , that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it . <END>
<BEGIN> edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior . <END>
<BEGIN> and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky , laughing up out of his gleeful eyes , and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby , without as much as by your leave , sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib . <END>
<BEGIN> —o my ! <END>
<BEGIN> puddeny pie ! <END>
<BEGIN> protested ciss . <END>
<BEGIN> he has his bib destroyed . <END>
<BEGIN> the slight _ contretemps _ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon o’hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands . <END>
<BEGIN> how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight , the last glimpse of erin , the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk , hither , thither , with a tiny lost cry . <END>
<BEGIN> and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _ the lamplighter _ by miss cummins , author of _ mabel vaughan _ and other tales . <END>
<BEGIN> for gerty had her dreams that no one knew of . <END>
<BEGIN> she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which , though it did not err on the side of luxury , was scrupulously neat and clean . <END>
<BEGIN> it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove , the tortoiseshell combs , her child of mary badge , the whiterose scent , the eyebrowleine , her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely’s of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs . <END>
<BEGIN> _ art thou real , my ideal it was called by louis j walsh , magherafelt , and after there was something about _ twilight , wilt thou ever and ofttimes the beauty of poetry , so sad in its transient loveliness , had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her , one by one , and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it . <END>
<BEGIN> but it must end , she felt . <END>
<BEGIN> if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her . <END>
<BEGIN> love laughs at locksmiths . <END>
<BEGIN> she would make the great sacrifice . <END>
<BEGIN> her every effort would be to share his thoughts . <END>
<BEGIN> dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness . <END>
<BEGIN> there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse , cruel only to be kind . <END>
<BEGIN> but even if—what then ? <END>
<BEGIN> would it make a very great difference ? <END>
<BEGIN> from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled . <END>
<BEGIN> she loathed that sort of person , the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour , degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station . <END>
<BEGIN> no , no : not that . <END>
<BEGIN> they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess . <END>
<BEGIN> perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall . <END>
<BEGIN> she thought she understood . <END>
<BEGIN> she would try to understand him because men were so different . <END>
<BEGIN> the old love was waiting , waiting with little white hands stretched out , with blue appealing eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> heart of mine ! <END>
<BEGIN> she would follow , her dream of love , the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all , the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide . <END>
<BEGIN> nothing else mattered . <END>
<BEGIN> come what might she would be wild , untrammelled , free . <END>
<BEGIN> canon o’hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _ laudate dominum omnes gentes _ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn’t she coming but jacky caffrey called out : —o , look , cissy ! <END>
<BEGIN> and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church , blue and then green and purple . <END>
<BEGIN> —it’s fireworks , cissy caffrey said . <END>
<BEGIN> and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church , helterskelter , edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running . <END>
<BEGIN> —come on , gerty , cissy called . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s the bazaar fireworks . <END>
<BEGIN> but gerty was adamant . <END>
<BEGIN> she had no intention of being at their beck and call . <END>
<BEGIN> if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was . <END>
<BEGIN> the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling . <END>
<BEGIN> she looked at him a moment , meeting his glance , and a light broke in upon her . <END>
<BEGIN> whitehot passion was in that face , passion silent as the grave , and it had made her his . <END>
<BEGIN> at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death , steadfast , a sterling man , a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips . <END>
<BEGIN> his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her . <END>
<BEGIN> she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that , supply soft and delicately rounded , and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart , his hoarse breathing , because she knew too about the passion of men like that , hotblooded , because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed . <END>
<BEGIN> but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips . <END>
<BEGIN> besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too , my dear , and winny rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did . <END>
<BEGIN> and jacky caffrey shouted to look , there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look , look , there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air , a soft thing , to and fro , dark . <END>
<BEGIN> and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees , up , up , and , in the tense hush , they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it , high , high , almost out of sight , and her face was suffused with a divine , an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too , nainsook knickers , the fabric that caresses the skin , better than those other pettiwidth , the green , four and eleven , on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking , looking . <END>
<BEGIN> she would fain have cried to him chokingly , held out her snowy slender arms to him to come , to feel his lips laid on her white brow , the cry of a young girl’s love , a little strangled cry , wrung from her , that cry that has rung through the ages . <END>
<BEGIN> and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o ! <END>
<BEGIN> then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o ! <END>
<BEGIN> and everyone cried o ! <END>
<BEGIN> o ! <END>
<BEGIN> in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah ! <END>
<BEGIN> they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden , o so lovely , o , soft , sweet , soft ! <END>
<BEGIN> then all melted away dewily in the grey air : all was silent . <END>
<BEGIN> ah ! <END>
<BEGIN> she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly , a pathetic little glance of piteous protest , of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl . <END>
<BEGIN> he was leaning back against the rock behind . <END>
<BEGIN> leopold bloom ( for it is he ) stands silent , with bowed head before those young guileless eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> what a brute he had been ! <END>
<BEGIN> at it again ? <END>
<BEGIN> a fair unsullied soul had called to him and , wretch that he was , how had he answered ? <END>
<BEGIN> an utter cad he had been ! <END>
<BEGIN> he of all men ! <END>
<BEGIN> but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes , for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered . <END>
<BEGIN> should a girl tell ? <END>
<BEGIN> no , a thousand times no . <END>
<BEGIN> that was their secret , only theirs , alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell . <END>
<BEGIN> cissy caffrey whistled , imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was : and then she cried : —gerty ! <END>
<BEGIN> gerty ! <END>
<BEGIN> we’re going . <END>
<BEGIN> come on . <END>
<BEGIN> we can see from farther up . <END>
<BEGIN> gerty had an idea , one of love’s little ruses . <END>
<BEGIN> she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back . <END>
<BEGIN> wonder if he’s too far to . <END>
<BEGIN> she rose . <END>
<BEGIN> was it goodbye ? <END>
<BEGIN> no . <END>
<BEGIN> she had to go but they would meet again , there , and she would dream of that till then , tomorrow , of her dream of yester eve . <END>
<BEGIN> she drew herself up to her full height . <END>
<BEGIN> their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart , full of a strange shining , hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face . <END>
<BEGIN> she half smiled at him wanly , a sweet forgiving smile , a smile that verged on tears , and then they parted . <END>
<BEGIN> slowly , without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy , to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey , to little baby boardman . <END>
<BEGIN> it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed . <END>
<BEGIN> she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because gerty macdowell <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> tight boots ? <END>
<BEGIN> no . <END>
<BEGIN> she’s lame ! <END>
<BEGIN> o ! <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom watched her as she limped away . <END>
<BEGIN> poor girl ! <END>
<BEGIN> that’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint . <END>
<BEGIN> thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib . <END>
<BEGIN> jilted beauty . <END>
<BEGIN> a defect is ten times worse in a woman . <END>
<BEGIN> but makes them polite . <END>

<BEGIN> your head it simply swirls . <END>
<BEGIN> he’s right . <END>
<BEGIN> might have made a worse fool of myself however . <END>
<BEGIN> instead of talking about nothing . <END>
<BEGIN> then i will tell you all . <END>
<BEGIN> still it was a kind of language between us . <END>
<BEGIN> it couldn’t be ? <END>
<BEGIN> no , gerty they called her . <END>

<BEGIN> glad after she was that ere adread was . <END>
<BEGIN> her he asked if o’hare doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that o’hare doctor in heaven was . <END>
<BEGIN> sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful . <END>
<BEGIN> all she there told him , ruing death for friend so young , algate sore unwilling god’s rightwiseness to withsay . <END>
<BEGIN> she said that he had a fair sweet death through god his goodness with masspriest to be shriven , holy housel and sick men’s oil to his limbs . <END>
<BEGIN> the man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in mona island through bellycrab three year agone come childermas and she prayed to god the allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness . <END>
<BEGIN> he heard her sad words , in held hat sad staring . <END>
<BEGIN> so stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other . <END>
<BEGIN> therefore , everyman , look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came . <END>
<BEGIN> the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed . <END>
<BEGIN> the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be . <END>
<BEGIN> she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth . <END>
<BEGIN> then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house . <END>
<BEGIN> the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid . <END>
<BEGIN> nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless . <END>
<BEGIN> and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat . <END>
<BEGIN> and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon . <END>
<BEGIN> and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice . <END>
<BEGIN> and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there . <END>
<BEGIN> and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile . <END>
<BEGIN> also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility . <END>
<BEGIN> but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle . <END>
<BEGIN> and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery . <END>
<BEGIN> and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment . <END>
<BEGIN> and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously . <END>
<BEGIN> and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles . <END>
<BEGIN> and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer . <END>
<BEGIN> and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so . <END>
<BEGIN> and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress . <END>
<BEGIN> and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain . <END>
<BEGIN> and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead . <END>
<BEGIN> and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each . <END>
<BEGIN> and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile . <END>
<BEGIN> and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile . <END>
<BEGIN> thanked be almighty god . <END>
<BEGIN> this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child , a gentle dame , whose time hied fast . <END>
<BEGIN> sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel , said he , that it be not come or now . <END>
<BEGIN> meseems it dureth overlong . <END>
<BEGIN> and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently . <END>
<BEGIN> but , said he , or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long . <END>
<BEGIN> and the franklin that had drunken said , expecting each moment to be her next . <END>
<BEGIN> also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and , now drink , said he , fully delectably , and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness . <END>
<BEGIN> and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup . <END>
<BEGIN> woman’s woe with wonder pondering . <END>
<BEGIN> now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might . <END>
<BEGIN> there was a sort of scholars along either side the board , that is to wit , dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable’s with other his fellows lynch and madden , scholars of medicine , and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa , one crotthers , and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested ( and of all them , reserved young stephen , he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead ) and beside the meek sir leopold . <END>
<BEGIN> but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow . <END>
<BEGIN> and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner . <END>
<BEGIN> ruth red him , love led on with will to wander , loth to leave . <END>
<BEGIN> for they were right witty scholars . <END>
<BEGIN> and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness , young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die ( for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case <END>
<BEGIN> and they said farther she should live because in the beginning , they said , the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die . <END>
<BEGIN> and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy . <END>
<BEGIN> a redress god grant . <END>
<BEGIN> this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay , by our virgin mother , the wife should live and the babe to die . <END>
<BEGIN> in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack . <END>
<BEGIN> then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved . <END>
<BEGIN> to whom young stephen had these words following : murmur , sirs , is eke oft among lay folk . <END>
<BEGIN> both babe and parent now glorify their maker , the one in limbo gloom , the other in purgefire . <END>
<BEGIN> but , gramercy , what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise , which is the sin against the holy ghost , very god , lord and giver of life ? <END>
<BEGIN> for , sirs , he said , our lust is brief . <END>
<BEGIN> we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we . <END>
<BEGIN> then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends . <END>
<BEGIN> but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead . <END>
<BEGIN> whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn , the other all this while , pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him , witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do . <END>
<BEGIN> thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever . <END>
<BEGIN> then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom , of law of canons , of lilith , patron of abortions , of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or , as virgilius saith , by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with , _ effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides . <END>
<BEGIN> he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal , even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded . <END>
<BEGIN> all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life . <END>
<BEGIN> a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and , laying hand to jaw , he said dissembling , as his wont was , that as it was informed him , who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman , and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions . <END>
<BEGIN> that is truth , pardy , said dixon , and , or i err , a pregnant word . <END>
<BEGIN> which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons . <END>
<BEGIN> but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny . <END>
<BEGIN> and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool , the flower of the flock , lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled ( for it was then about the midst of the winter ) and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage ( for all accounted him of real parts ) so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores . <END>
<BEGIN> about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who , praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff , he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray . <END>
<BEGIN> now drink we , quod he , of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment . <END>
<BEGIN> leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone . <END>
<BEGIN> be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay . <END>
<BEGIN> see ye here . <END>
<BEGIN> and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had , he said , for a song which he writ . <END>
<BEGIN> they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore . <END>
<BEGIN> his words were then these as followeth : know all men , he said , time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions . <END>
<BEGIN> what means this ? <END>
<BEGIN> desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time . <END>
<BEGIN> mark me now . <END>

<BEGIN> hereupon punch costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _ staboo stabella _ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in almany which he did straightways now attack : _ the first three months she was not well , staboo when here nurse quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard . <END>
<BEGIN> it was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking , in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage , nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently punch costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him , a murrain seize the dolt , what a devil he would be at , thou chuff , thou puny , thou got in peasestraw , thou losel , thou chitterling , thou spawn of a rebel , thou dykedropt , thou abortion thou , to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of god ape , the good sir leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet , margerain gentle , advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred . <END>
<BEGIN> in horne’s house rest should reign . <END>
<BEGIN> to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles , goodly grinning , asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb , chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days . <END>
<BEGIN> master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how , as he heard hereof counted , he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too , waxing merry and toasting to his fathership . <END>
<BEGIN> but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin . <END>
<BEGIN> thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses , as the priests use in madagascar island , she to be in guise of white and saffron , her groom in white and grain , with burning of nard and tapers , on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _ ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium _ till she was there unmaided . <END>
<BEGIN> he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets master john fletcher and master francis beaumont that is in their _ maid’s tragedy _ that was writ for a like twining of lovers : _ to bed , to bed _ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals . <END>

<BEGIN> and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm . <END>
<BEGIN> then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour . <END>

<BEGIN> he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden , being godly certain whiles , knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom , at the braggart’s side , spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear , advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard , the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead , look you , having taken place , and all of the order of a natural phenomenon . <END>
<BEGIN> but was young boasthard’s fear vanquished by calmer’s words ? <END>

<BEGIN> and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other ? <END>
<BEGIN> he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either . <END>
<BEGIN> but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal ? <END>
<BEGIN> indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle . <END>
<BEGIN> heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or , what calmer said , a hubbub of phenomenon ? <END>
<BEGIN> heard ? <END>
<BEGIN> why , he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding ( which he had not done <END>
<BEGIN> for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show . <END>

<BEGIN> by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law . <END>
<BEGIN> then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe on - me , that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it ? <END>
<BEGIN> yes , pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name , she said , is bird in - the hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as , ho , you pretty man , turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place , and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two in - the bush or , by some learned , carnal concupiscence . <END>
<BEGIN> this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird in - the hand ( which was within all foul plagues , monsters and a wicked devil ) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her . <END>

<BEGIN> with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him ( for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it ) but on stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk . <END>
<BEGIN> he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women , horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat . <END>
<BEGIN> to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps , ostlers , bookies , paul’s men , runners , flatcaps , waistcoateers , ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip . <END>
<BEGIN> he took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue , some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides . <END>

<BEGIN> faith , no , he says , frank ( that was his name ’tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague . <END>

<BEGIN> from a child this frank had been a donought that his father , a headborough , who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes , matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes . <END>
<BEGIN> one time he would be a playactor , then a sutler or a welsher , then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main , then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk , kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge . <END>

<BEGIN> i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats , says he . <END>
<BEGIN> i can scarce believe ’tis so bad , says he . <END>
<BEGIN> and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers , greasy hoggets and wether wool , having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe , a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low’s yard in prussia street . <END>
<BEGIN> i question with you there , says he . <END>
<BEGIN> more like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue . <END>
<BEGIN> mr stephen , a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality , that was sending over doctor rinderpest , the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy , with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns . <END>
<BEGIN> come , come , says mr vincent , plain dealing . <END>
<BEGIN> he’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s irish , says he . <END>
<BEGIN> irish by name and irish by nature , says mr stephen , and he sent the ale purling about , an irish bull in an english chinashop . <END>
<BEGIN> i conceive you , says mr dixon . <END>
<BEGIN> it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas , the bravest cattlebreeder of them all , with an emerald ring in his nose . <END>
<BEGIN> true for you , says mr vincent cross the table , and a bullseye into the bargain , says he , and a plumper and a portlier bull , says he , never shit on shamrock . <END>
<BEGIN> he had horns galore , a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island , leaving doughballs and rollingpins , followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains . <END>
<BEGIN> what for that , says mr dixon , but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself . <END>
<BEGIN> so be off now , says he , and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing , and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly . <END>
<BEGIN> but the slap and the blessing stood him friend , says mr vincent , for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid , wife , abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland . <END>
<BEGIN> another then put in his word : and they dressed him , says he , in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content . <END>
<BEGIN> by this time the father of the faithful ( for so they called him ) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture . <END>
<BEGIN> to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him . <END>
<BEGIN> ay , says another , and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself ( for that was the only colour to his mind ) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice , saying : by the lord harry , green is the grass that grows on the ground . <END>
<BEGIN> and , says mr dixon , if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry’s orders . <END>
<BEGIN> there was bad blood between them at first , says mr vincent , and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i’ll meddle in his matters , says he . <END>
<BEGIN> i’ll make that animal smell hell , says he , with the help of that good pizzle my father left me . <END>
<BEGIN> but one evening , says mr dixon , when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace ( he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks ) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans , _ bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show . <END>
<BEGIN> after that , says mr vincent , the lord harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name . <END>
<BEGIN> then , with the water running off him , he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy , the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat . <END>
<BEGIN> in short , he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt . <END>
<BEGIN> they were , says mr stephen , and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward , as the ungrate women were all of one mind , made a wherry raft , loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard , set all masts erect , manned the yards , sprang their luff , heaved to , spread three sheets in the wind , put her head between wind and water , weighed anchor , ported her helm , ran up the jolly roger , gave three times three , let the bullgine run , pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america . <END>
<BEGIN> which was the occasion , says mr vincent , of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty : _ —pope peter’s but a pissabed . <END>
<BEGIN> a man’s a man for a’ <URL> our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered , a young gentleman , his name alec bannon , who had late come to town , it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars . <END>
<BEGIN> mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on . <END>
<BEGIN> whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics : _ mr malachi mulligan . <END>
<BEGIN> fertiliser and incubator . <END>
<BEGIN> lambay island <END>
<BEGIN> his project , as he went on to expound , was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed . <END>
<BEGIN> well , let us hear of it , good my friend , said mr dixon . <END>
<BEGIN> i make no doubt it smacks of wenching . <END>
<BEGIN> come , be seated , both . <END>
<BEGIN> ’tis as cheap sitting as standing . <END>
<BEGIN> mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and , expatiating upon his design , told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility , both the inhibitory and the prohibitory , whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired . <END>
<BEGIN> it grieved him plaguily , he said , to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges : and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures , a prey to the vilest bonzes , who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness , sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress , this , he assured them , made his heart weep . <END>
<BEGIN> to curb this inconvenient ( which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter , he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder , lord talbot de malahide , a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party . <END>
<BEGIN> he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _ omphalos _ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural . <END>
<BEGIN> money was no object , he said , nor would he take a penny for his pains . <END>
<BEGIN> the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion , if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions , would find in him their man . <END>
<BEGIN> for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there , the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose , both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies . <END>
<BEGIN> after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it . <END>
<BEGIN> they both , it seems , had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water , as might be observed by mr mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald . <END>
<BEGIN> his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary’s excepted to it , asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle . <END>
<BEGIN> mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which , as it dwelt upon his memory , seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention : _ talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi , o quirites , ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach , the buck and doe of the forest glade , the farmyard drake and duck . <END>
<BEGIN> valuing himself not a little upon his elegance , being indeed a proper man of person , this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced . <END>
<BEGIN> the young gentleman , his friend , overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him , could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour . <END>
<BEGIN> mr mulligan , now perceiving the table , asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and , seeing the stranger , he made him a civil bow and said , pray , sir , was you in need of any professional assistance we could give ? <END>
<BEGIN> who , upon his offer , thanked him very heartily , though preserving his proper distance , and replied that he was come there about a lady , now an inmate of horne’s house , that was in an interesting condition , poor body , from woman’s woe ( and here he fetched a deep sigh ) to know if her happiness had yet taken place . <END>
<BEGIN> mr dixon , to turn the table , took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence , upon which he rallied him , betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due , as with the noted physician , mr austin meldon , to a wolf in the stomach . <END>
<BEGIN> for answer mr mulligan , in a gale of laughter at his smalls , smote himself bravely below the diaphragm , exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan ( the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop there’s a belly that never bore a bastard . <END>
<BEGIN> this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight . <END>
<BEGIN> the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber . <END>
<BEGIN> here the listener who was none other than the scotch student , a little fume of a fellow , blond as tow , congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and , interrupting the narrative at a salient point , having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head ( a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture ) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it . <END>
<BEGIN> _ mais bien sûr noble stranger , said he cheerily , _ et mille compliments <END>
<BEGIN> that you may and very opportunely . <END>
<BEGIN> there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity . <END>
<BEGIN> but , gracious heaven , was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well , my god , i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things . <END>
<BEGIN> with these words he approached the goblet to his lips , took a complacent draught of the cordial , slicked his hair and , opening his bosom , out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband , that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein . <END>
<BEGIN> gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness , ah , monsieur , he said , had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap ( a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily ) in such an artless disorder , of so melting a tenderness , ’pon my conscience , even you , monsieur , had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever . <END>
<BEGIN> i declare , i was never so touched in all my life . <END>
<BEGIN> god , i thank thee , as the author of my days ! <END>
<BEGIN> thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours . <END>
<BEGIN> a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and , having replaced the locket in his bosom , he wiped his eye and sighed again . <END>
<BEGIN> beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures , how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond , the simple swain and the polished coxcomb , the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years . <END>
<BEGIN> but indeed , sir , i wander from the point . <END>
<BEGIN> how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys . <END>
<BEGIN> maledicity ! <END>
<BEGIN> he exclaimed in anguish . <END>
<BEGIN> would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along ! <END>
<BEGIN> i could weep to think of it . <END>
<BEGIN> then , though it had poured seven showers , we were neither of us a penny the worse . <END>
<BEGIN> but beshrew me , he cried , clapping hand to his forehead , tomorrow will be a new day and , thousand thunders , i know of a _ marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz , from whom i can have for a _ livre _ as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting . <END>
<BEGIN> tut , tut ! <END>
<BEGIN> cries le fécondateur , tripping in , my friend monsieur moore , that most accomplished traveller ( i have just cracked a half bottle _ avec lui _ in a circle of the best wits of the town is my authority that in cape horn , _ ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any , even the stoutest cloak . <END>
<BEGIN> a drenching of that violence , he tells me , _ sans blague has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world . <END>
<BEGIN> pooh ! <END>
<BEGIN> a _ livre cries monsieur lynch . <END>
<BEGIN> the clumsy things are dear at a sou . <END>
<BEGIN> one umbrella , were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom , is worth ten such stopgaps . <END>
<BEGIN> no woman of any wit would wear one . <END>
<BEGIN> my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for , as she reminded me ( blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame nature , by the divine blessing , has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _ il y a deux choses _ for which the innocence of our original garb , in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties , is the fittest , nay , the only garment . <END>
<BEGIN> the first , said she ( and here my pretty philosopher , as i handed her to her tilbury , to fix my attention , gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear the first is a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge . <END>
<BEGIN> amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and , while all were conjecturing what might be the cause , miss callan entered and , having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon , retired with a profound bow to the company . <END>
<BEGIN> the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry . <END>
<BEGIN> strike me silly , said costello , a low fellow who was fuddled . <END>
<BEGIN> a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh ! <END>
<BEGIN> i’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you . <END>
<BEGIN> what , you dog ? <END>
<BEGIN> have you a way with them ? <END>
<BEGIN> gad’s bud , immensely so , said mr lynch . <END>
<BEGIN> the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice . <END>
<BEGIN> demme , does not doctor o’gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin . <END>
<BEGIN> as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months . <END>
<BEGIN> lawksamercy , doctor , cried the young blood in the primrose vest , feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body , how you do tease a body ! <END>
<BEGIN> drat the man ! <END>
<BEGIN> bless me , i’m all of a wibbly wobbly . <END>
<BEGIN> why , you’re as bad as dear little father cantekissem , that you are ! <END>
<BEGIN> may this pot of four half choke me , cried costello , if she aint in the family way . <END>
<BEGIN> i knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her . <END>
<BEGIN> the young surgeon , however , rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward . <END>
<BEGIN> merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _ enceinte _ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy . <END>
<BEGIN> i want patience , said he , with those who , without wit to enliven or learning to instruct , revile an ennobling profession which , saving the reverence due to the deity , is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth . <END>
<BEGIN> i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which , so far from being a byword , should be a glorious incentive in the human breast . <END>
<BEGIN> i cannot away with them . <END>
<BEGIN> what ? <END>
<BEGIN> malign such an one , the amiable miss callan , who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours ? <END>
<BEGIN> and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay ? <END>
<BEGIN> perish the thought ! <END>
<BEGIN> i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne . <END>
<BEGIN> having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door . <END>
<BEGIN> a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado , a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation ( for he swore a round hand ) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath . <END>
<BEGIN> stap my vitals , said he , them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart . <END>
<BEGIN> to revert to mr bloom who , after his first entry , had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity . <END>
<BEGIN> the young sparks , it is true , were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children : the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice : their testiness and outrageous _ mots _ were such that his intellects resiled from : nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf . <END>
<BEGIN> but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity , born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world , which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to , so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin . <END>
<BEGIN> it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and , being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast , he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and , by intercepting them with the readiest precaution , foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at , rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable . <END>
<BEGIN> to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy ( a habit of mind which he never did hold with ) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding : while for such that , having lost all forbearance , can lose no more , there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat . <END>
<BEGIN> not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which , caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe , is ever ( as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it ) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions . <END>
<BEGIN> to conclude , while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was , however , it must be owned , not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being . <END>
<BEGIN> accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour , saying that , to express his notion of the thing , his opinion ( who ought not perchance to express one ) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers . <END>
<BEGIN> the dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron . <END>
<BEGIN> i must acquaint you , said mr crotthers , clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis , old glory allelujurum was round again today , an elderly man with dundrearies , preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina , my life , as he calls her . <END>
<BEGIN> i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon . <END>
<BEGIN> ’slife , i’ll be round with you . <END>
<BEGIN> i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her . <END>
<BEGIN> all fell to praising of it , each after his own fashion , though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap , a clerk in orders , a linkboy ( virtuous ) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household . <END>
<BEGIN> singular , communed the guest with himself , the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them , that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity , that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest . <END>
<BEGIN> but , he further added , it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together . <END>
<BEGIN> but with what fitness , let it be asked of the noble lord , his patron , has this alien , whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights , constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity ? <END>

<BEGIN> the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion , feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress : a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her . <END>

<BEGIN> his soul is far away . <END>

<BEGIN> the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop . <END>
<BEGIN> during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton on - trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance . <END>
<BEGIN> he was simply and solely , as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself , which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings , after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf , recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn . <END>
<BEGIN> eventually , however , both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with , also at the same time , however , a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place . <END>

<BEGIN> there too , opposite to him , was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom . <END>
<BEGIN> next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello , the eccentric , while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden . <END>
<BEGIN> the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan . <END>
<BEGIN> lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion , while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator , fresh from the hippodrome , and that vigilant wanderer , soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour , but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come . <END>

<BEGIN> in the rough sands of the <URL> a cabletow’s length from the <URL> where the tide <URL> and flows <URL> silent , thoughtful , alert he stands on guard , his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master . <END>
<BEGIN> against the dark wall a figure appears slowly , a fairy boy of eleven , a changeling , kidnapped , dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet , holding a book in his hand . <END>
<BEGIN> he reads from right to left inaudibly , smiling , kissing the page . <END>
<BEGIN> bloom : wonderstruck , calls inaudibly . <END>
<BEGIN> rudy ! <END>
<BEGIN> rudy : gazes , unseeing , into bloom’s eyes and goes on reading , kissing , smiling . <END>
<BEGIN> he has a delicate mauve face . <END>
<BEGIN> on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons . <END>
<BEGIN> in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot . <END>
<BEGIN> a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket . <END>
<BEGIN> — iii — preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed . <END>
<BEGIN> his ( stephen’s ) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting , off the reel , the propriety of the cabman’s shelter , as it was called , hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral . <END>
<BEGIN> but how to get there was the rub . <END>
<BEGIN> for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned . <END>
<BEGIN> so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition , both of them being <URL> particularly stephen , always assuming that there was such a thing to be found . <END>
<BEGIN> accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing , in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line , they both walked together along beaver street or , more properly , lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin’s . <END>
<BEGIN> but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler , probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree , outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom , who was anything but a professional whistler , endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle , holding his arms arched over his head , twice . <END>
<BEGIN> this was a quandary but , bringing common sense to bear on it , evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did . <END>
<BEGIN> so , bevelling around by mullett’s and the signal house which they shortly reached , they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus , mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had , to vary the timehonoured adage , gone the way of all buttons though , entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing , he heroically made light of the mischance . <END>
<BEGIN> so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time , as it happened , and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius , they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey . <END>
<BEGIN> as it so happened a dublin united tramways company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _ à propos _ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back . <END>
<BEGIN> they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station , the starting point for belfast , where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue ( a not very enticing locality , not to say gruesome to a degree , more especially at night ) ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street , famous for its c division police station . <END>
<BEGIN> between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen , associated with baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in talbot place , first turning on the right , while the other who was acting as his _ fidus achates _ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke’s city bakery , situated quite close to where they were , the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread , of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable . <END>
<BEGIN> bread , the staff of life , earn your bread , o tell me where is fancy bread , at rourke’s the baker’s it is said . <END>
<BEGIN> _ en route _ to his taciturn and , not to put too fine a point on it , not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties , never more so , in fact disgustingly sober , spoke a word of caution _ re _ the dangers of nighttown , women of ill fame and swell mobsmen , which , barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice , was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out . <END>
<BEGIN> highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or , failing that , the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or , he being the solicitor rather , old wall , he meant to say , or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about . <END>
<BEGIN> the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen , whom he cordially disliked , were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and , as mr bloom put it , recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street , prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot . <END>
<BEGIN> never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city , pembroke road for example , the guardians of the law were well in evidence , the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes . <END>
<BEGIN> another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything . <END>
<BEGIN> you frittered away your time , he very sensibly maintained , and health and also character besides which , the squandermania of the thing , fast women of the _ demimonde _ ran away with a lot of £ . <END>
<BEGIN> s . d . into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though , touching the much vexed question of stimulants , he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues ( notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in ) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically . <END>
<BEGIN> most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting _ confrères _ but one , a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs . <END>
<BEGIN> —and that one was judas , stephen said , who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind . <END>
<BEGIN> discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox . <END>
<BEGIN> he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _ quondam _ friend of his father’s , gumley . <END>
<BEGIN> to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge . <END>
<BEGIN> —someone saluted you , mr bloom said . <END>
<BEGIN> a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again , calling : —night ! <END>
<BEGIN> stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _ qui vive _ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least . <END>
<BEGIN> though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper , famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice , your money or your life , leaving you there to point a moral , gagged and garrotted . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters , though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice . <END>
<BEGIN> lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise . <END>
<BEGIN> he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division , lately deceased , who had married a certain katherine brophy , the daughter of a louth farmer . <END>
<BEGIN> his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine ( also ) talbot . <END>
<BEGIN> rumour had it ( though not proved ) that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion , really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing , her mother or aunt or some relative , a woman , as the tale went , of extreme beauty , had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen . <END>
<BEGIN> this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley . <END>
<BEGIN> taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell . <END>
<BEGIN> not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings . <END>
<BEGIN> his friends had all deserted him . <END>
<BEGIN> furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions . <END>
<BEGIN> he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god’s earth he could get something , anything at all , to do . <END>
<BEGIN> no , it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way , both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish . <END>
<BEGIN> anyhow he was all in . <END>
<BEGIN> —i wouldn’t ask you only , pursued he , on my solemn oath and god knows i’m on the rocks . <END>
<BEGIN> —there’ll be a job tomorrow or next day , stephen told him , in a boys’ school at dalkey for a gentleman usher . <END>
<BEGIN> mr garrett deasy . <END>
<BEGIN> try it . <END>
<BEGIN> you may mention my name . <END>
<BEGIN> —ah , god , corley replied , sure i couldn’t teach in a school , man . <END>
<BEGIN> i was never one of your bright ones , he added with a half laugh . <END>
<BEGIN> i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers . <END>
<BEGIN> —i have no place to sleep myself , stephen informed him . <END>
<BEGIN> corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street . <END>
<BEGIN> there was a dosshouse in marlborough street , mrs maloney’s , but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m’conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street ( which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon ) for a bob . <END>
<BEGIN> he was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it . <END>
<BEGIN> though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence . <END>
<BEGIN> however _ haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera _ as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished . <END>
<BEGIN> but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful . <END>
<BEGIN> whereas . <END>
<BEGIN> he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for , to his chagrin , he found his cash missing . <END>
<BEGIN> a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation . <END>
<BEGIN> he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout , very much the reverse in fact . <END>
<BEGIN> he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect . <END>
<BEGIN> about biscuits he dimly remembered . <END>
<BEGIN> who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy . <END>
<BEGIN> however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies , erroneously however , as it turned out . <END>
<BEGIN> —those are halfcrowns , man , corley corrected him . <END>
<BEGIN> and so in point of fact they turned out to be . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen anyhow lent him one of them . <END>
<BEGIN> —thanks , corley answered , you’re a gentleman . <END>
<BEGIN> i’ll pay you back one time . <END>
<BEGIN> who’s that with you ? <END>
<BEGIN> i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan , the billsticker . <END>
<BEGIN> you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there . <END>
<BEGIN> i’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks , man . <END>
<BEGIN> god , you’ve to book ahead , man , you’d think it was for the carl rosa . <END>
<BEGIN> i don’t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job , even as a crossing sweeper . <END>
<BEGIN> subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullam’s , the shipchandler’s , bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle’s back with o’mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe . <END>
<BEGIN> anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work , it struck him , was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept . <END>
<BEGIN> he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when . <END>
<BEGIN> being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity . <END>
<BEGIN> palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round , in every deep , so to put it , a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _ rara avis _ altogether . <END>
<BEGIN> in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning . <END>
<BEGIN> pretty thick that was certainly . <END>
<BEGIN> the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who , with his practised eye , was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite . <END>
<BEGIN> alluding to the encounter he said , laughingly , stephen , that is : —he is down on his luck . <END>
<BEGIN> he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan , a billsticker , to give him a job as a sandwichman . <END>
<BEGIN> at this intelligence , in which he seemingly evinced little interest , mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger , rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana , moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair , whereupon he observed evasively : —everybody gets their own ration of luck , they say . <END>
<BEGIN> now you mention it his face was familiar to me . <END>
<BEGIN> but , leaving that for the moment , how much did you part with , he queried , if i am not too inquisitive ? <END>
<BEGIN> —half a crown , stephen responded . <END>
<BEGIN> i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere . <END>
<BEGIN> —needs ! <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom ejaculated , professing not the least surprise at the intelligence , i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does . <END>
<BEGIN> everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds . <END>
<BEGIN> but , talking about things in general , where , added he with a smile , will you sleep yourself ? <END>
<BEGIN> walking to sandycove is out of the question . <END>
<BEGIN> and even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at westland row station . <END>
<BEGIN> simply fag out there for nothing . <END>
<BEGIN> i don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house ? <END>
<BEGIN> —to seek misfortune , was stephen’s answer . <END>
<BEGIN> —i met your respected father on a recent occasion , mr bloom diplomatically returned , today in fact , or to be strictly accurate , on yesterday . <END>
<BEGIN> where does he live at present ? <END>
<BEGIN> i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved . <END>
<BEGIN> —i believe he is in dublin somewhere , stephen answered unconcernedly . <END>
<BEGIN> why ? <END>
<BEGIN> —a gifted man , mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior , in more respects than one and a born _ raconteur _ if ever there was one . <END>
<BEGIN> he takes great pride , quite legitimate , out of you . <END>
<BEGIN> you could go back perhaps , he hasarded , still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two , mulligan , that is , and that english tourist friend of his , who eventually euchred their third companion , were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion , which they did . <END>
<BEGIN> there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however , such as it was , stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle , her hair hanging down , waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy , boody and katey , the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper , in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded , it being quarter tense or if not , ember days or something like that . <END>
<BEGIN> —no , mr bloom repeated again , i wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element , dr mulligan , as a guide , philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes . <END>
<BEGIN> he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals . <END>
<BEGIN> of course you didn’t notice as much as i did . <END>
<BEGIN> but it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object . <END>
<BEGIN> he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man , by no means confined to medicine only , who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and , if the report was verified , bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries , or malahide was it was , he was bound to admit , an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise , so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy , pure and simple . <END>
<BEGIN> —except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains , he ventured to throw out . <END>
<BEGIN> the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light , none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less . <END>
<BEGIN> grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that , high educational abilities though he possessed , he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet . <END>
<BEGIN> adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way , there being some little differences between the parties . <END>
<BEGIN> — _ puttana madonna , che ci dia i quattrini ! <END>
<BEGIN> ho ragione ? <END>
<BEGIN> culo rotto _ —intendiamoci . <END>
<BEGIN> mezzo sovrano <URL> _ —dice lui , però <URL> _ —farabutto ! <END>
<BEGIN> mortacci sui _ —ma ascolta ! <END>
<BEGIN> cinque la testa <URL> mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman’s shelter , an unpretentious wooden structure , where , prior to then , he had rarely if ever been before , the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin the - goat fitzharris , the invincible , though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in . <END>
<BEGIN> a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _ homo _ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity . <END>
<BEGIN> —now touching a cup of coffee , mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice , it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food , say , a roll of some description . <END>
<BEGIN> accordingly his first act was with characteristic _ sangfroid _ to order these commodities quietly . <END>
<BEGIN> the _ hoi polloi _ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied , away though one redbearded bibulous individual , portion of whose hair was greyish , a sailor probably , still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom , availing himself of the right of free speech , he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute , though , to be sure , rather in a quandary over _ voglio remarked to his _ protégé _ in an audible tone of voice _ à propos _ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious : —a beautiful language . <END>
<BEGIN> i mean for singing purposes . <END>
<BEGIN> why do you not write your poetry in that language ? <END>
<BEGIN> _ bella poetria <END>
<BEGIN> it is so melodious and full . <END>
<BEGIN> _ belladonna . <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> stephen , who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could , suffering from lassitude generally , replied : —to fill the ear of a cow elephant . <END>
<BEGIN> they were haggling over money . <END>
<BEGIN> —is that so ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom asked . <END>
<BEGIN> of course , he subjoined pensively , at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary , it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it . <END>
<BEGIN> the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _ tête à - tête _ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun , or so it seemed . <END>
<BEGIN> after which he beat a retreat to his counter , mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to . <END>
<BEGIN> for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him . <END>
<BEGIN> —sounds are impostures , stephen said after a pause of some little time , like names . <END>
<BEGIN> cicero , podmore , napoleon , mr goodbody . <END>
<BEGIN> jesus , mr doyle . <END>
<BEGIN> shakespeares were as common as murphies . <END>
<BEGIN> what’s in a name ? <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , to be sure , mr bloom unaffectedly concurred . <END>
<BEGIN> of course . <END>
<BEGIN> our name was changed too , he added , pushing the socalled roll across . <END>
<BEGIN> the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen , whom he had singled out for attention in particular , squarely by asking : —and what might your name be ? <END>
<BEGIN> just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion’s boot but stephen , apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter , answered : —dedalus . <END>
<BEGIN> the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes , rather bunged up from excessive use of boose , preferably good old hollands and water . <END>
<BEGIN> —you know simon dedalus ? <END>
<BEGIN> he asked at length . <END>
<BEGIN> —i’ve heard of him , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom was all at sea for a moment , seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too . <END>
<BEGIN> —he’s irish , the seaman bold affirmed , staring still in much the same way and nodding . <END>
<BEGIN> all irish . <END>
<BEGIN> —all too irish , stephen rejoined . <END>
<BEGIN> as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark : —i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder . <END>
<BEGIN> the lefthand dead shot . <END>
<BEGIN> though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain . <END>
<BEGIN> —bottles out there , say . <END>
<BEGIN> fifty yards measured . <END>
<BEGIN> eggs on the bottles . <END>
<BEGIN> cocks his gun over his shoulder . <END>
<BEGIN> aims . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned his body half round , shut up his right eye completely . <END>
<BEGIN> then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance . <END>
<BEGIN> —pom ! <END>
<BEGIN> he then shouted once . <END>
<BEGIN> the entire audience waited , anticipating an additional detonation , there being still a further egg . <END>
<BEGIN> —pom ! <END>
<BEGIN> he shouted twice . <END>
<BEGIN> egg two evidently demolished , he nodded and winked , adding bloodthirstily : _ —buffalo bill shoots to kill , never missed nor he never <URL> a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley . <END>
<BEGIN> —beg pardon , the sailor said . <END>
<BEGIN> —long ago ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth . <END>
<BEGIN> —why , the sailor replied , relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond , it might be a matter of ten years . <END>
<BEGIN> he toured the wide world with hengler’s royal circus . <END>
<BEGIN> i seen him do that in stockholm . <END>
<BEGIN> —curious coincidence , mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively . <END>
<BEGIN> —murphy’s my name , the sailor continued . <END>
<BEGIN> d . b . murphy of carrigaloe . <END>
<BEGIN> know where that is ? <END>
<BEGIN> —queenstown harbour , stephen replied . <END>
<BEGIN> —that’s right , the sailor said . <END>
<BEGIN> fort camden and fort carlisle . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s where i hails from . <END>
<BEGIN> i belongs there . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s where i hails from . <END>
<BEGIN> my little woman’s down there . <END>
<BEGIN> she’s waiting for me , i know . <END>
<BEGIN> _ for england , home and beauty <END>
<BEGIN> she’s my own true wife i haven’t seen for seven years now , sailing about . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene , the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones , a rainy night with a blind moon . <END>
<BEGIN> across the world for a wife . <END>
<BEGIN> quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic , enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc o’leary , a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way . <END>
<BEGIN> never about the runaway wife coming back , however much devoted to the absentee . <END>
<BEGIN> the face at the window ! <END>
<BEGIN> judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half , wrecked in his affections . <END>
<BEGIN> you little expected me but i’ve come to stay and make a fresh start . <END>
<BEGIN> there she sits , a grasswidow , at the selfsame fireside . <END>
<BEGIN> believes me dead , rocked in the cradle of the deep . <END>
<BEGIN> and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin , as the case might be , the publican of the crown and anchor , in shirtsleeves , eating rumpsteak and onions . <END>
<BEGIN> no chair for father . <END>
<BEGIN> broo ! <END>
<BEGIN> the wind ! <END>
<BEGIN> her brandnew arrival is on her knee , _ post mortem _ child . <END>
<BEGIN> with a high ro ! <END>
<BEGIN> and a randy ro ! <END>
<BEGIN> and my galloping tearing tandy , o ! <END>
<BEGIN> bow to the inevitable . <END>
<BEGIN> grin and bear it . <END>
<BEGIN> i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband w . b . murphy . <END>
<BEGIN> the sailor , who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident , turned to one of the jarvies with the request : —you don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you ? <END>
<BEGIN> the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand . <END>
<BEGIN> —thank you , the sailor said . <END>
<BEGIN> he deposited the quid in his gob and , chewing and with some slow stammers , proceeded : —we come up this morning eleven o’clock . <END>
<BEGIN> the threemaster _ rosevean _ from bridgwater with bricks . <END>
<BEGIN> i shipped to get over . <END>
<BEGIN> paid off this afternoon . <END>
<BEGIN> there’s my discharge . <END>
<BEGIN> see ? <END>
<BEGIN> d . b . murphy . <END>
<BEGIN> a . <END>
<BEGIN> b . s . in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document . <END>
<BEGIN> —you must have seen a fair share of the world , the keeper remarked , leaning on the counter . <END>
<BEGIN> —why , the sailor answered upon reflection upon it , i’ve circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on . <END>
<BEGIN> i was in the red sea . <END>
<BEGIN> i was in china and north america and south america . <END>
<BEGIN> we was chased by pirates one voyage . <END>
<BEGIN> i seen icebergs plenty , growlers . <END>
<BEGIN> i was in stockholm and the black sea , the dardanelles under captain dalton , the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship . <END>
<BEGIN> i seen russia . <END>
<BEGIN> _ gospodi pomilyou <END>
<BEGIN> that’s how the russians prays . <END>
<BEGIN> —you seen queer sights , don’t be talking , put in a jarvey . <END>
<BEGIN> —why , the sailor said , shifting his partially chewed plug . <END>
<BEGIN> i seen queer things too , ups and downs . <END>
<BEGIN> i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid . <END>
<BEGIN> he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and , lodging it between his teeth , bit ferociously : —khaan ! <END>
<BEGIN> like that . <END>
<BEGIN> and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses . <END>
<BEGIN> look here . <END>
<BEGIN> here they are . <END>
<BEGIN> a friend of mine sent me . <END>
<BEGIN> he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table . <END>
<BEGIN> the printed matter on it stated : _ choza de indios . <END>
<BEGIN> beni , <URL> all focussed their attention at the scene exhibited , a group of savage women in striped loincloths , squatted , blinking , suckling , frowning , sleeping amid a swarm of infants ( there must have been quite a score of them ) outside some primitive shanties of osier . <END>
<BEGIN> —chews coca all day , the communicative tarpaulin added . <END>
<BEGIN> stomachs like breadgraters . <END>
<BEGIN> cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children . <END>
<BEGIN> see them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw . <END>
<BEGIN> his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more . <END>
<BEGIN> —know how to keep them off ? <END>
<BEGIN> he inquired generally . <END>
<BEGIN> nobody volunteering a statement he winked , saying : —glass . <END>
<BEGIN> that boggles ’em . <END>
<BEGIN> glass . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom , without evincing surprise , unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark . <END>
<BEGIN> it ran as follows : _ tarjeta postal , señor a boudin , galeria becche , santiago , <URL> there was no message evidently , as he took particular notice . <END>
<BEGIN> though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated ( or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillo don cesar de bazan incident depicted in _ maritana _ on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat ) having detected a discrepancy between his name ( assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> somewhere ) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s _ bona fides _ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london _ via _ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest . <END>
<BEGIN> martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through . <END>
<BEGIN> but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd’s heart it was not so dear , purse permitting , a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six , there and back . <END>
<BEGIN> the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable , especially for a chap whose liver was out of order , seeing the different places along the route , plymouth , falmouth , southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis , the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement , tower , abbey , wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with . <END>
<BEGIN> another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts , margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas , eastbourne , scarborough , margate and so on , beautiful bournemouth , the channel islands and similar bijou spots , which might prove highly remunerative . <END>
<BEGIN> not , of course , with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job , witness mrs c p m’coy type lend me your valise and i’ll post you the ticket . <END>
<BEGIN> no , something top notch , an all star irish caste , the tweedy flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody manners , perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success , providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure . <END>
<BEGIN> but who ? <END>
<BEGIN> that was the rub . <END>
<BEGIN> also , without being actually positive , it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _ apropos _ of the fishguard rosslare route which , it was mooted , was once more on the _ tapis _ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally . <END>
<BEGIN> a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large , the average man , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> brown , robinson and co . <END>
<BEGIN> it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street , when the system really needed toning up , for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick in - the mud took me for a wife . <END>
<BEGIN> after all , hang it , they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _ venue _ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life . <END>
<BEGIN> there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island , delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation , offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even , poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram , but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow , rightly termed the garden of ireland , an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down , and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the _ coup d’œil _ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise , silken thomas , grace o’malley , george iv , rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy , though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally , usually , by the way , on their left leg , it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar . <END>
<BEGIN> because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy , so to speak , and the accommodation left much to be desired . <END>
<BEGIN> interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity , pure and simple , was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned back the other side of the card , picture , and passed it along to stephen . <END>
<BEGIN> —i seen a chinese one time , related the doughty narrator , that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different . <END>
<BEGIN> one was a ship , another was a house , another was a flower . <END>
<BEGIN> cooks rats in your soup , he appetisingly added , the chinks does . <END>
<BEGIN> possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on , adhering to his adventures . <END>
<BEGIN> —and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap . <END>
<BEGIN> knife in his back . <END>
<BEGIN> knife like that . <END>
<BEGIN> whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position . <END>
<BEGIN> —in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers . <END>
<BEGIN> fellow hid behind a door , come up behind him . <END>
<BEGIN> like that . <END>
<BEGIN> _ prepare to meet your god says he . <END>
<BEGIN> chuk ! <END>
<BEGIN> it went into his back up to the butt . <END>
<BEGIN> his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to . <END>
<BEGIN> —that’s a good bit of steel , repeated he , examining his formidable _ stiletto <END>
<BEGIN> after which harrowing _ dénouement _ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors , otherwise pocket . <END>
<BEGIN> —they’re great for the cold steel , somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all . <END>
<BEGIN> that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives . <END>
<BEGIN> at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _ where ignorance is bliss _ mr b . and stephen , each in his own particular way , both instinctively exchanged meaning glances , in a religious silence of the strictly _ entre nous _ variety however , towards where skin the - goat , _ alias _ the keeper , not turning a hair , was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair . <END>
<BEGIN> his inscrutable face which was really a work of art , a perfect study in itself , beggaring description , conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on . <END>
<BEGIN> funny , very ! <END>
<BEGIN> there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause . <END>
<BEGIN> one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal , another the card with the natives _ choza de another the seaman’s discharge . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom , so far as he was personally concerned , was just pondering in pensive mood . <END>
<BEGIN> he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday , roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles , when it took the civilised world by storm , figuratively speaking , early in the eighties , eightyone to be correct , when he was just turned fifteen . <END>
<BEGIN> —ay , boss , the sailor broke in . <END>
<BEGIN> give us back them papers . <END>
<BEGIN> the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape . <END>
<BEGIN> —have you seen the rock of gibraltar ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom inquired . <END>
<BEGIN> the sailor grimaced , chewing , in a way that might be read as yes , ay or no . <END>
<BEGIN> —ah , you’ve touched there too , mr bloom said , europa point , thinking he had , in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so , simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust , and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn . <END>
<BEGIN> —what year would that be about ? <END>
<BEGIN> mr b interrogated . <END>
<BEGIN> can you recall the boats ? <END>
<BEGIN> our _ soi disant _ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering : —i’m tired of all them rocks in the sea , he said , and boats and ships . <END>
<BEGIN> salt junk all the time . <END>
<BEGIN> tired seemingly , he ceased . <END>
<BEGIN> his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer , fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe , suffice it to say that , as a casual glance at the map revealed , it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves . <END>
<BEGIN> on more than one occasion , a dozen at the lowest , near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt , evidently derelict , seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall , staring quite obliviously at it and it at him , dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings . <END>
<BEGIN> and it left him wondering why . <END>
<BEGIN> possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself , floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under , well , not exactly under , tempting the fates . <END>
<BEGIN> and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all . <END>
<BEGIN> nevertheless , without going into the _ minutiae _ of the business , the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large , no matter where living inland or seaside , as the case might be , having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _ ireland expects that every man _ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights , kish and others , liable to capsize at any moment , rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy , not to say stormy , weather . <END>
<BEGIN> —there was a fellow sailed with me in the _ rover the old seadog , himself a rover , proceeded , went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month . <END>
<BEGIN> them are his trousers i’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m game for that job , shaving and brushup . <END>
<BEGIN> i hate roaming about . <END>
<BEGIN> there’s my son now , danny , run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in cork where he could be drawing easy money . <END>
<BEGIN> —what age is he ? <END>
<BEGIN> queried one hearer who , by the way , seen from the side , bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell , the townclerk , away from the carking cares of office , unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage . <END>
<BEGIN> —why , the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance , my son , danny ? <END>
<BEGIN> he’d be about eighteen now , way i figure it . <END>
<BEGIN> the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor . <END>
<BEGIN> —there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater , he remarked , sure as nuts . <END>
<BEGIN> i must get a wash tomorrow or next day . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s them black lads i objects to . <END>
<BEGIN> i hate those buggers . <END>
<BEGIN> suck your blood dry , they does . <END>
<BEGIN> seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather . <END>
<BEGIN> —tattoo , the exhibitor explained . <END>
<BEGIN> that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton . <END>
<BEGIN> fellow , the name of antonio , done that . <END>
<BEGIN> there he is himself , a greek . <END>
<BEGIN> —did it hurt much doing it ? <END>
<BEGIN> one asked the sailor . <END>
<BEGIN> that worthy , however , was busily engaged in collecting round the . <END>
<BEGIN> someway in his . <END>
<BEGIN> squeezing or . <END>
<BEGIN> —see here , he said , showing antonio . <END>
<BEGIN> there he is cursing the mate . <END>
<BEGIN> and there he is now , he added , the same fellow , pulling the skin with his fingers , some special knack evidently , and he laughing at a yarn . <END>
<BEGIN> and in point of fact the young man named antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skin the - goat , who this time stretched over . <END>
<BEGIN> —ay , ay , sighed the sailor , looking down on his manly chest . <END>
<BEGIN> he’s gone too . <END>
<BEGIN> ate by sharks after . <END>
<BEGIN> ay , ay . <END>
<BEGIN> he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before . <END>
<BEGIN> —neat bit of work , one longshoreman said . <END>
<BEGIN> —and what’s the number for ? <END>
<BEGIN> loafer number two queried . <END>
<BEGIN> —eaten alive ? <END>
<BEGIN> a third asked the sailor . <END>
<BEGIN> —ay , ay , sighed again the latter personage , more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number . <END>
<BEGIN> ate . <END>
<BEGIN> a greek he was . <END>
<BEGIN> and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end : —as bad as old antonio , for he left me on my ownio . <END>
<BEGIN> the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom , scarcely knowing which way to look , turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm , and , picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey , if such he was , had laid aside , he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink . <END>
<BEGIN> his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay , the partially idiotic female , namely , of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you ( mrs <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> and begged the chance of his washing . <END>
<BEGIN> also why washing which seemed rather vague than not , your washing . <END>
<BEGIN> still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with bewley and draper’s marking ink ( hers were , that is ) if they really loved him , that is to say , love me , love my dirty shirt . <END>
<BEGIN> still just then , being on tenterhooks , he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off . <END>
<BEGIN> round the side of the _ evening telegraph _ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there , viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her . <END>
<BEGIN> —the gunboat , the keeper said . <END>
<BEGIN> —it beats me , mr bloom confided to stephen , medically i am speaking , how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses , if he values his health in the least . <END>
<BEGIN> unfortunate creature ! <END>
<BEGIN> of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition . <END>
<BEGIN> still no matter what the cause is <URL> stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders , merely remarking : —in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade . <END>
<BEGIN> fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul . <END>
<BEGIN> she is a bad merchant . <END>
<BEGIN> she buys dear and sells cheap . <END>
<BEGIN> the elder man , though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude , said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _ instanter _ to say that women of that stamp ( quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil , were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities , a thing , he could truthfully state , he , as a _ paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start . <END>
<BEGIN> whoever embarked on a policy of the sort , he said , and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned . <END>
<BEGIN> —you as a good catholic , he observed , talking of body and soul , believe in the soul . <END>
<BEGIN> or do you mean the intelligence , the brainpower as such , as distinct from any outside object , the table , let us say , that cup . <END>
<BEGIN> i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter . <END>
<BEGIN> otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays , for instance . <END>
<BEGIN> do you ? <END>
<BEGIN> thus cornered , stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say : —they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible . <END>
<BEGIN> it would be immortal , i understand , but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who , from all i can hear , is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes , _ corruptio per se _ and _ corruptio per accidens _ both being excluded by court etiquette . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple , promptly rejoining : —simple ? <END>
<BEGIN> i shouldn’t think that is the proper word . <END>
<BEGIN> of course , i grant you , to concede a point , you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon . <END>
<BEGIN> but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison , though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man , i mean , and the same applies to the laws , for example , of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god . <END>
<BEGIN> —o that , stephen expostulated , has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ , apart from circumstantial evidence . <END>
<BEGIN> on this knotty point however the views of the pair , poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages , clashed . <END>
<BEGIN> —has been ? <END>
<BEGIN> the more experienced of the two objected , sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m not so sure about that . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and , without dragging in the sectarian side of the business , i beg to differ with you _ in toto _ there . <END>
<BEGIN> my belief is , to tell you the candid truth , that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again , who precisely wrote them like _ hamlet _ and bacon , as , you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i , of course i needn’t tell you . <END>
<BEGIN> can’t you drink that coffee , by the way ? <END>
<BEGIN> let me stir it . <END>
<BEGIN> and take a piece of that bun . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised . <END>
<BEGIN> still no one can give what he hasn’t got . <END>
<BEGIN> try a bit . <END>
<BEGIN> —couldn’t , stephen contrived to get out , his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further . <END>
<BEGIN> faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance ( and lucrative ) work . <END>
<BEGIN> to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good , shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night , concerts , dramatic evenings and useful lectures ( admittance free ) by qualified men for the lower orders . <END>
<BEGIN> on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife , madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time , a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying . <END>
<BEGIN> the idea , he was strongly inclined to believe , was to do good and net a profit , there being no competition to speak of . <END>
<BEGIN> sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where . <END>
<BEGIN> anyhow inspection , medical inspection , of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble’s vi cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved . <END>
<BEGIN> —have a shot at it now , he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred . <END>
<BEGIN> thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage . <END>
<BEGIN> —still it’s solid food , his good genius urged , i’m a stickler for solid food , his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _ sine qua non _ for any kind of proper work , mental or manual . <END>
<BEGIN> you ought to eat more solid food . <END>
<BEGIN> you would feel a different man . <END>
<BEGIN> —liquids i can eat , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> but o , oblige me by taking away that knife . <END>
<BEGIN> i can’t look at the point of it . <END>
<BEGIN> it reminds me of roman history . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article , a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye , observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it . <END>
<BEGIN> —our mutual friend’s stories are like himself , mr bloom _ apropos _ of knives remarked to his _ confidante sotto voce <END>
<BEGIN> do you think they are genuine ? <END>
<BEGIN> he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots . <END>
<BEGIN> look at him . <END>
<BEGIN> yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel . <END>
<BEGIN> he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him . <END>
<BEGIN> though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina , if a trifle prone to baldness , there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity . <END>
<BEGIN> he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told , as people often did about others , namely , that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage ( no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet ) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described . <END>
<BEGIN> on the other hand he might be only bluffing , a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs , dublin residents , like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _ hesperus _ and etcetera . <END>
<BEGIN> and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him . <END>
<BEGIN> —mind you , i’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention , he resumed . <END>
<BEGIN> analogous scenes are occasionally , if not often , met with . <END>
<BEGIN> giants , though that is rather a far cry , you see once in a way , marcella the midget queen . <END>
<BEGIN> in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs , as they are called , sitting bowlegged , they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here , you see , he proceeded , indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee , were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up , being adored as gods . <END>
<BEGIN> there’s an example again of simple souls . <END>
<BEGIN> however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures ( who reminded him a bit of ludwig , _ alias _ ledwidge , when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the _ flying dutchman a stupendous success , and his host of admirers came in large numbers , everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort , phantom or the reverse , on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains ) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it , he conceded . <END>
<BEGIN> on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _ de rigueur _ off him or her next day on the quiet and , he added , on the cheap . <END>
<BEGIN> —spaniards , for instance , he continued , passionate temperaments like that , impetuous as old nick , are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen . <END>
<BEGIN> it comes from the great heat , climate generally . <END>
<BEGIN> my wife is , so to speak , spanish , half that is . <END>
<BEGIN> point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted , having been born in ( technically ) spain , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> gibraltar . <END>
<BEGIN> she has the spanish type . <END>
<BEGIN> quite dark , regular brunette , black . <END>
<BEGIN> i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian . <END>
<BEGIN> —the temperaments at the door , stephen interposed with , were very passionate about ten shillings . <END>
<BEGIN> _ roberto ruba roba sua <END>
<BEGIN> —quite so , mr bloom dittoed . <END>
<BEGIN> —then , stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere , we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino . <END>
<BEGIN> —it’s in the blood , mr bloom acceded at once . <END>
<BEGIN> all are washed in the blood of the sun . <END>
<BEGIN> coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today , shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it , and i was just looking at those antique statues there . <END>
<BEGIN> the splendid proportions of hips , bosom . <END>
<BEGIN> you simply don’t knock against those kind of women here . <END>
<BEGIN> an exception here and there . <END>
<BEGIN> handsome yes , pretty in a way you find but what i’m talking about is the female form . <END>
<BEGIN> besides they have so little taste in dress , most of them , which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty , no matter what you say . <END>
<BEGIN> rumpled stockings , it may be , possibly is , a foible of mine but still it’s a thing i simply hate to see . <END>
<BEGIN> interest , however , was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea , ships lost in a fog , collisions with icebergs , all that sort of thing . <END>
<BEGIN> shipahoy of course had his own say to say . <END>
<BEGIN> he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon , a kind of wind , in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing , he declared , stood to him or words to that effect , a pious medal he had that saved him . <END>
<BEGIN> so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt’s rock , wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it _ palme _ on booterstown strand . <END>
<BEGIN> that was the talk of the town that year ( albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish _ times breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror . <END>
<BEGIN> then someone said something about the case of the s . s . _ lady cairns _ of swansea run into by the _ mona _ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck . <END>
<BEGIN> no aid was given . <END>
<BEGIN> her master , the _ mona _ ’s , said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way . <END>
<BEGIN> she had no water , it appears , in her hold . <END>
<BEGIN> at this stage an incident happened . <END>
<BEGIN> it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat . <END>
<BEGIN> —let me cross your bows mate , he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze . <END>
<BEGIN> he made tracks heavily , slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door , stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left . <END>
<BEGIN> while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior , saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and , applying its nozzle to his lips , take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise . <END>
<BEGIN> the irrepressible bloom , who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes , could by straining just perceive him , when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit , gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved . <END>
<BEGIN> some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor , evidently giving it a wide berth , eased himself closer at hand , the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank . <END>
<BEGIN> a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled . <END>
<BEGIN> slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who , though now broken down and fast breaking up , was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid , now practically on the parish rates , given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus , a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of . <END>
<BEGIN> and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver . <END>
<BEGIN> he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if , however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality . <END>
<BEGIN> all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping , coastwise and foreign as well , which was all part and parcel of the same thing . <END>
<BEGIN> a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin , the only launch that year . <END>
<BEGIN> right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called . <END>
<BEGIN> there were wrecks and wreckers , the keeper said , who was evidently _ au fait <END>
<BEGIN> what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that , eh ? <END>
<BEGIN> ask the then captain , he advised them , how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day’s work , captain john lever of the lever line . <END>
<BEGIN> —am i right , skipper ? <END>
<BEGIN> he queried of the sailor , now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions . <END>
<BEGIN> that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds . <END>
<BEGIN> mr bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably ( which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question . <END>
<BEGIN> anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation cum potation , introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _ soirée boisterously trolling , like a veritable son of a seacook : —the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lot’s wife’s arse . <END>
<BEGIN> o , johnny lever ! <END>
<BEGIN> johnny lever , o ! <END>
<BEGIN> after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided . <END>
<BEGIN> skin the - goat , assuming he was he , evidently with an axe to grind , was airing his grievances in a forcible feeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of god’s earth , far and away superior to england , with coal in large quantities , six million pounds worth of pork exported every year , ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein . <END>
<BEGIN> their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact . <END>
<BEGIN> you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil , he stated , and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco . <END>
<BEGIN> where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon ? <END>
<BEGIN> but a day of reckoning , he stated _ crescendo _ with no uncertain voice , thoroughly monopolising all the conversation , was in store for mighty england , despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes . <END>
<BEGIN> there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history . <END>
<BEGIN> the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin , he affirmed . <END>
<BEGIN> the boers were the beginning of the end . <END>
<BEGIN> brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland , her achilles heel , which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles , the greek hero , a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot . <END>
<BEGIN> his advice to every irishman was : stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland . <END>
<BEGIN> ireland , parnell said , could not spare a single one of her sons . <END>
<BEGIN> silence all round marked the termination of his _ finale <END>
<BEGIN> the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings , undismayed . <END>
<BEGIN> —take a bit of doing , boss , retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism . <END>
<BEGIN> to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view . <END>
<BEGIN> —who’s the best troops in the army ? <END>
<BEGIN> the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated . <END>
<BEGIN> and the best jumpers and racers ? <END>
<BEGIN> and the best admirals and generals we’ve got ? <END>
<BEGIN> tell me that . <END>
<BEGIN> —the irish , for choice , retorted the cabby like campbell , facial blemishes apart . <END>
<BEGIN> —that’s right , the old tarpaulin corroborated . <END>
<BEGIN> the irish catholic peasant . <END>
<BEGIN> he’s the backbone of our empire . <END>
<BEGIN> you know jem mullins ? <END>
<BEGIN> while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire , ours or his , and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it . <END>
<BEGIN> then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter , both , needless to say , appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows . <END>
<BEGIN> from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for , pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for , he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel , unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for , rather concealed their strength than the opposite . <END>
<BEGIN> it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if , as time went on , that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies , equally relevant to the issue , might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart . <END>
<BEGIN> another little interesting point , the amours of whores and chummies , to put it in common parlance , reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her , more so , in fact . <END>
<BEGIN> and now , why ? <END>
<BEGIN> so the scene between the pair of them , the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris , the famous invincible , and the other , obviously bogus , reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick , supposing , that is , it was prearranged as the lookeron , a student of the human soul if anything , the others seeing least of the game . <END>
<BEGIN> and as for the lessee or keeper , who probably wasn’t the other person at all , he <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting , there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like denis or peter carey , an idea he utterly repudiated . <END>
<BEGIN> quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle . <END>
<BEGIN> yet , though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form , he certainly did feel and no denying it ( while inwardly remaining what he was ) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife , cold steel , with the courage of his political convictions ( though , personally , he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south , have her or swing for her , when the husband frequently , after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal ( he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _ liaison _ by plunging his knife into her , until it just struck him that fitz , nicknamed skin the - goat , merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not , if he was reliably informed , actually party to the ambush which , in point of fact , was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on . <END>
<BEGIN> in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend , the pseudo skin the - etcetera , he had transparently outlived his welcome . <END>
<BEGIN> he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high . <END>
<BEGIN> like actresses , always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again . <END>
<BEGIN> generous to a fault of course , temperamental , no economising or any idea of the sort , always snapping at the bone for the shadow . <END>
<BEGIN> so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some £ . <END>
<BEGIN> s . d . in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _ old ireland _ tavern , come back to erin and so on . <END>
<BEGIN> then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender . <END>
<BEGIN> —he took umbrage at something or other , that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared , i let slip . <END>
<BEGIN> he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively . <END>
<BEGIN> so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god , i mean christ , was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality i’m not . <END>
<BEGIN> that was one for him . <END>
<BEGIN> a soft answer turns away wrath . <END>
<BEGIN> he hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw . <END>
<BEGIN> am i not right ? <END>
<BEGIN> he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly . <END>
<BEGIN> — _ ex quibus stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent , their two or four eyes conversing , _ christus _ or bloom his name is or after all any other , _ secundum carnem <END>
<BEGIN> —of course , mr b . proceeded to stipulate , you must look at both sides of the question . <END>
<BEGIN> it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country , they say , our own distressful included , has the government it deserves . <END>
<BEGIN> but with a little goodwill all round . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality . <END>
<BEGIN> i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form . <END>
<BEGIN> it never reaches anything or stops anything . <END>
<BEGIN> a revolution must come on the due instalments plan . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular , in the next house so to speak . <END>
<BEGIN> —memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war , stephen assented , between skinner’s alley and ormond market . <END>
<BEGIN> yes , mr bloom thoroughly agreed , entirely endorsing the remark , that was overwhelmingly right . <END>
<BEGIN> and the whole world was full of that sort of thing . <END>
<BEGIN> —you just took the words out of my mouth , he said . <END>
<BEGIN> a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t <URL> all those wretched quarrels , in his humble opinion , stirring up bad blood , from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind , erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag , were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything , greed and jealousy , people never knowing when to stop . <END>
<BEGIN> —they accuse , remarked he audibly . <END>
<BEGIN> he turned away from the others , who probably… and spoke nearer to , so as the others… in case they… —jews , he softly imparted in an aside in stephen’s ear , are accused of ruining . <END>
<BEGIN> not a vestige of truth in it , i can safely say . <END>
<BEGIN> history , would you be surprised to learn , proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell , an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for , imported them . <END>
<BEGIN> why ? <END>
<BEGIN> because they are imbued with the proper spirit . <END>
<BEGIN> they are practical and are proved to be so . <END>
<BEGIN> i don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are . <END>
<BEGIN> but in the economic , not touching religion , domain the priest spells poverty . <END>
<BEGIN> spain again , you saw in the war , compared with goahead america . <END>
<BEGIN> turks . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s in the dogma . <END>
<BEGIN> because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better , at least so i think . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s the juggle on which the <URL> raise the wind on false pretences . <END>
<BEGIN> i’m , he resumed with dramatic force , as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone , concluded he , all creeds and classes _ pro rata _ having a comfortable tidysized income , in no niggard fashion either , something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man . <END>
<BEGIN> at least that’s my idea for what it’s worth . <END>
<BEGIN> i call that patriotism . <END>
<BEGIN> _ ubi patria as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _ alma mater , vita bene <END>
<BEGIN> where you can live well , the sense is , if you work . <END>
<BEGIN> over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee , listening to this synopsis of things in general , stephen stared at nothing in particular . <END>
<BEGIN> he could hear , of course , all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to . <END>
<BEGIN> then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said , if you work . <END>
<BEGIN> —count me out , he managed to remark , meaning work . <END>
<BEGIN> the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he , the person who owned them pro tem . <END>
<BEGIN> observed or rather his voice speaking did , all must work , have to , together . <END>
<BEGIN> —i mean , of course , the other hastened to affirm , work in the widest possible sense . <END>
<BEGIN> also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing . <END>
<BEGIN> writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays . <END>
<BEGIN> that’s work too . <END>
<BEGIN> important work . <END>
<BEGIN> after all , from the little i know of you , after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price . <END>
<BEGIN> you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has . <END>
<BEGIN> what ? <END>
<BEGIN> you both belong to ireland , the brain and the brawn . <END>
<BEGIN> each is equally important . <END>
<BEGIN> —you suspect , stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh , that i may be important because i belong to the _ faubourg saint patrice _ called ireland for short . <END>
<BEGIN> —i would go a step farther , mr bloom insinuated . <END>
<BEGIN> —but i suspect , stephen interrupted , that ireland must be important because it belongs to me . <END>
<BEGIN> —what belongs , queried mr bloom bending , fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension . <END>
<BEGIN> excuse me . <END>
<BEGIN> unfortunately , i didn’t catch the latter portion . <END>
<BEGIN> what was it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , patently crosstempered , repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely , adding : —we can’t change the country . <END>
<BEGIN> let us change the subject . <END>
<BEGIN> at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom , to change the subject , looked down but in a quandary , as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry . <END>
<BEGIN> the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part . <END>
<BEGIN> needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state . <END>
<BEGIN> probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people . <END>
<BEGIN> with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris , the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister , failing to throw much light on the subject , however , he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves . <END>
<BEGIN> for instance there was the case of o’callaghan , for one , the halfcrazy faddist , respectably connected though of inadequate means , with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper ( a fact <END>
<BEGIN> and then the usual _ dénouement _ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends , after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard , so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act , certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains . <END>
<BEGIN> briefly , putting two and two together , six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to , antonio and so forth , jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne , then heir apparent , the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state , he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature , a thing good mrs grundy , as the law stands , was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it . <END>

<BEGIN> he saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _ insuppressible _ or was it _ united ireland a privilege he keenly appreciated , and , in point of fact , handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _ thank you excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip : what’s bred in the bone . <END>
<BEGIN> still as regards return . <END>
<BEGIN> you were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back . <END>
<BEGIN> then a lot of shillyshally usually followed , tom for and dick and harry against . <END>
<BEGIN> and then , number one , you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the tichborne case , roger charles tichborne , _ bella _ was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he , the heir , went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink , lord bellew was it , as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then , when got up to tally with the description given , introduce himself with : _ excuse me , my name is so and so _ or some such commonplace remark . <END>
<BEGIN> a more prudent course , as bloom said to the not over effusive , in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him , would have been to sound the lie of the land first . <END>
<BEGIN> —that bitch , that english whore , did for him , the shebeen proprietor commented . <END>
<BEGIN> she put the first nail in his coffin . <END>
<BEGIN> —fine lump of a woman all the same , the _ soi disant _ townclerk henry campbell remarked , and plenty of her . <END>
<BEGIN> she loosened many a man’s thighs . <END>
<BEGIN> i seen her picture in a barber’s . <END>
<BEGIN> the husband was a captain or an officer . <END>
<BEGIN> —ay , skin the - goat amusingly added , he was and a cottonball one . <END>
<BEGIN> this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _ entourage <END>
<BEGIN> as regards bloom he , without the faintest suspicion of a smile , merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts , to make matters worse , were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings . <END>
<BEGIN> first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed , however , who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into . <END>
<BEGIN> since their names were coupled , though , since he was her declared favourite , where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops , the fact , namely , that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel , having gained admittance in the same fashion , a fact the weeklies , addicted to the lubric a little , simply coined shoals of money out of . <END>
<BEGIN> whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch , with nothing in common between them beyond the name , and then a real man arriving on the scene , strong to the verge of weakness , falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties , the usual sequel , to bask in the loved one’s smiles . <END>
<BEGIN> the eternal question of the life connubial , needless to say , cropped up . <END>
<BEGIN> can real love , supposing there happens to be another chap in the case , exist between married folk ? <END>
<BEGIN> poser . <END>
<BEGIN> though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection , carried away by a wave of folly . <END>
<BEGIN> a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order , as compared with the other military supernumerary that is ( who was just the usual everyday _ farewell , my gallant captain _ kind of an individual in the light dragoons , the 18th hussars to be accurate ) and inflammable doubtless ( the fallen leader , that is , not the other ) in his own peculiar way which she of course , woman , quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole , his erstwhile staunch adherents , and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations , very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose , thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick . <END>
<BEGIN> looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream . <END>
<BEGIN> and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times . <END>
<BEGIN> why , as he reflected , irishtown strand , a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since , as it happened , he went to reside on the north side . <END>
<BEGIN> north or south , however , it was just the wellknown case of hot passion , pure and simple , upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so , types that wouldn’t do things by halves , passionate abandon of the south , casting every shred of decency to the winds . <END>
<BEGIN> —just bears out what i was saying , he , with glowing bosom said to stephen , about blood and the sun . <END>
<BEGIN> and , if i don’t greatly mistake she was spanish too . <END>
<BEGIN> —the king of spain’s daughter , stephen answered , adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and so many . <END>
<BEGIN> —was she ? <END>
<BEGIN> bloom ejaculated , surprised though not astonished by any means , i never heard that rumour before . <END>
<BEGIN> possible , especially there , it was as she lived there . <END>
<BEGIN> so , spain . <END>
<BEGIN> carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _ sweets of which reminded him by the by of that capel street library book out of date , he took out his pocketbook and , turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he . <END>
<BEGIN> —do you consider , by the by , he said , thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table , that a spanish type ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , obviously addressed , looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom , with more than vision of breasts , her full lips parted and some perfect teeth , standing near , ostensibly with gravity , a piano on the rest of which was _ in old madrid a ballad , pretty in its way , which was then all the vogue . <END>
<BEGIN> her ( the lady’s ) eyes , dark , large , looked at stephen , about to smile about something to be admired , lafayette of westmoreland street , dublin’s premier photographic artist , being responsible for the esthetic execution . <END>
<BEGIN> —mrs bloom , my wife the _ prima donna _ madam marion tweedy , bloom indicated . <END>
<BEGIN> taken a few years since . <END>
<BEGIN> in or about ninety six . <END>
<BEGIN> very like her then . <END>
<BEGIN> beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who , he intimated , was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen . <END>
<BEGIN> as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup . <END>
<BEGIN> she could without difficulty , he said , have posed for the ensemble , not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the . <END>
<BEGIN> he dwelt , being a bit of an artist in his spare time , on the female form in general developmentally because , as it so happened , no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues , perfectly developed as works of art , in the national museum . <END>
<BEGIN> marble could give the original , shoulders , back , all the symmetry , all the rest . <END>
<BEGIN> yes , puritanisme , it does though , saint joseph’s sovereign thievery alors ( bandez <END>
<BEGIN> figne toi trop . <END>
<BEGIN> whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word . <END>
<BEGIN> the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself , her stage presence being , frankly , a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to . <END>
<BEGIN> but it was scarcely professional etiquette so . <END>
<BEGIN> though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering , for sunshine after storm . <END>
<BEGIN> and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion . <END>
<BEGIN> nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves , none the worse for wear however , and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _ embonpoint <END>
<BEGIN> in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled , good as new , much better in fact with the starch out . <END>
<BEGIN> suppose she was gone when he ? <END>
<BEGIN> i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray . <END>
<BEGIN> the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished , educated , _ distingué _ and impulsive into the bargain , far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would . <END>
<BEGIN> besides he said the picture was handsome which , say what you like , it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter . <END>
<BEGIN> and why not ? <END>
<BEGIN> an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business . <END>
<BEGIN> how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations , when the thing ran its normal course , became in due course intimate . <END>
<BEGIN> then the decree _ nisi _ and the king’s proctor tries to show cause why and , he failing to quash it , _ nisi _ was made absolute . <END>
<BEGIN> but as for that the two misdemeanants , wrapped up as they largely were in one another , could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course . <END>
<BEGIN> he , b , enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _ fracas _ when the fallen leader’s , who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery , ( leader’s ) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _ insuppressible _ or no it was _ united ireland _ ( a by no means by the by appropriate appellative ) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the o’brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals . <END>
<BEGIN> though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she , however , was the first to perceive . <END>
<BEGIN> as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach , fortunately not of a grave character . <END>
<BEGIN> his hat ( parnell’s ) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and , as a matter of strict history , bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him ( and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity ) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he , as a matter of fact , having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else , what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _ aplomb saying : _ thank you , sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day , history repeating itself with a difference , after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave . <END>
<BEGIN> on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest , laughing immoderately , pretending to understand everything , the why and the wherefore , and in reality not knowing their own minds , it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones , who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms , drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others . <END>
<BEGIN> he personally , being of a sceptical bias , believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady , even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument , when , neglecting her duties , she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent , the upshot being that her affections centred on another , the cause of many _ liaisons _ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men , no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt . <END>
<BEGIN> it was a thousand pities a young fellow , blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was , should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime . <END>
<BEGIN> in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a _ conditio sine qua non _ though he had the gravest possible doubts , not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson ( who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs . <END>
<BEGIN> to think of him house and homeless , rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother , was really too bad at his age . <END>
<BEGIN> the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or , failing that , the homely humpty dumpty boiled . <END>
<BEGIN> —at what o’clock did you dine ? <END>
<BEGIN> he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face . <END>
<BEGIN> —some time yesterday , stephen said . <END>
<BEGIN> —yesterday ! <END>
<BEGIN> exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday . <END>
<BEGIN> ah , you mean it’s after twelve ! <END>
<BEGIN> —the day before yesterday , stephen said , improving on himself . <END>
<BEGIN> literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected . <END>
<BEGIN> though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling , so to speak , in the one train of thought . <END>
<BEGIN> at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _ quasi _ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect ( which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself ) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas . <END>
<BEGIN> for instance when the evicted tenants question , then at its first inception , bulked largely in people’s mind though , it goes without saying , not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums , some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water , he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion ( a partiality , however , which , realising his mistake , he was subsequently partially cured of ) and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander , which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that he , though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals , be it repeated , departed from his customary habit to give him ( metaphorically ) one in the gizzard though , so far as politics themselves were concerned , he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows , chiefly , destruction of the fittest , in a word . <END>
<BEGIN> anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons , getting on for one , as it was , it was high time to be retiring for the night . <END>
<BEGIN> the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue ( somebody having a temper of her own sometimes ) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog ( breed unknown ) with a lame paw ( not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too ) to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered , having been there , so to speak . <END>
<BEGIN> on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives . <END>
<BEGIN> everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity , all things considered . <END>
<BEGIN> his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway . <END>
<BEGIN> for one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea , if approached , and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly , supposing he did entertain the proposal , as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe , if found suitable . <END>
<BEGIN> at all events he wound up by concluding , eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent , a cup of epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up . <END>
<BEGIN> a move had to be made because that merry old soul , the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot , didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come , alternately racking their feelings ( the mermaids’ ) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address , as mr algebra remarks _ passim <END>
<BEGIN> at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew . <END>
<BEGIN> people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep . <END>
<BEGIN> the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles . <END>
<BEGIN> your god was a jew . <END>
<BEGIN> because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrick on - shannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo . <END>
<BEGIN> —i propose , our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo , as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over . <END>
<BEGIN> my diggings are quite close in the vicinity . <END>
<BEGIN> you can’t drink that stuff . <END>
<BEGIN> do you like cocoa ? <END>
<BEGIN> wait . <END>
<BEGIN> i’ll just pay this lot . <END>
<BEGIN> the best plan clearly being to clear out , the remainder being plain sailing , he beckoned , while prudently pocketing the photo , to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , that’s the best , he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less . <END>
<BEGIN> all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his ( b’s ) busy brain , education ( the genuine article literature , journalism , prize titbits , up to date billing , concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres , turning money away , duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things , no necessity , of course , to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it , and a slice of luck . <END>
<BEGIN> an opening was all was wanted . <END>
<BEGIN> because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well , by the way no harm , to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to . <END>
<BEGIN> the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy , earl cadogan , had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in london somewhere . <END>
<BEGIN> silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement . <END>
<BEGIN> then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect . <END>
<BEGIN> to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why . <END>
<BEGIN> —give us a squint at that literature , grandfather , the ancient mariner put in , manifesting some natural impatience . <END>
<BEGIN> —and welcome , answered the elderly party thus addressed . <END>
<BEGIN> the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears . <END>
<BEGIN> —are you bad in the eyes ? <END>
<BEGIN> the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried . <END>
<BEGIN> —why , answered the seafarer with the tartan beard , who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way , staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as , i uses goggles reading . <END>
<BEGIN> sand in the red sea done that . <END>
<BEGIN> one time i could read a book in the dark , manner of speaking . <END>
<BEGIN> _ the arabian nights entertainment _ was my favourite and _ red as a rose is <URL> hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what , found drowned or the exploits of king willow , iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts , during which time ( completely regardless of ire ) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it , all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions , that is to say , either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark . <END>
<BEGIN> to cut a long story short bloom , grasping the situation , was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost , being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion , taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming , making a grand total of fourpence ( the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers , literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures , coffee 2d , confectionery do , and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way , as wetherup used to remark . <END>
<BEGIN> —come , he counselled to close the _ séance <END>
<BEGIN> seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _ élite _ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _ dolce far niente <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out , paused at the , for a moment , the door . <END>
<BEGIN> —one thing i never understood , he said to be original on the spur of the moment . <END>
<BEGIN> why they put tables upside down at night , i mean chairs upside down , on the tables in cafés . <END>
<BEGIN> to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation , saying straight off : —to sweep the floor in the morning . <END>
<BEGIN> so saying he skipped around , nimbly considering , frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right , a habit of his , by the bye , his right side being , in classical idiom , his tender achilles . <END>
<BEGIN> the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins . <END>
<BEGIN> —it will ( the air ) do you good , bloom said , meaning also the walk , in a moment . <END>
<BEGIN> the only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man . <END>
<BEGIN> come . <END>
<BEGIN> it’s not far . <END>
<BEGIN> lean on me . <END>
<BEGIN> accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen’s right and led him on accordingly . <END>
<BEGIN> —yes , stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him , sinewless and wobbly and all that . <END>
<BEGIN> anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones , brazier etc . <END>
<BEGIN> where the municipal supernumerary , ex gumley , was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy , as the adage has it , dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new . <END>
<BEGIN> and _ apropos _ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class , probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings . <END>
<BEGIN> so they turned on to chatting about music , a form of art for which bloom , as a pure amateur , possessed the greatest love , as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place . <END>
<BEGIN> wagnerian music , though confessedly grand in its way , was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go off but the music of mercadante’s _ huguenots meyerbeer’s _ seven last words on the cross _ and mozart’s _ twelfth mass _ he simply revelled in , the _ gloria _ in that being , to his mind , the acme of first class music as such , literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat . <END>
<BEGIN> he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or _ bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be <END>
<BEGIN> he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossini’s _ stabat mater a work simply abounding in immortal numbers , in which his wife , madam marion tweedy , made a hit , a veritable sensation , he might safely say , greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade , in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper gardiner street , the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos , or _ virtuosi _ rather . <END>
<BEGIN> there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore . <END>
<BEGIN> on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _ don giovanni _ description and _ martha a gem in its line , he had a _ penchant though with only a surface knowledge , for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn . <END>
<BEGIN> and talking of that , taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites , he mentioned _ par excellence _ lionel’s air in _ martha , m’appari which , curiously enough , he had heard or overheard , to be more accurate , on yesterday , a privilege he keenly appreciated , from the lips of stephen’s respected father , sung to perfection , a study of the number , in fact , which made all the others take a back seat . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen , in reply to a politely put query , said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeare’s songs , at least of in or about that period , the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist , who _ anno ludendo hausi , doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch , whom b . did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar , for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their _ dux _ and _ comes _ conceits and byrd ( william ) who played the virginals , he said , in the queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull . <END>
<BEGIN> on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse , dragging a sweeper , paced on the paven ground , brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull . <END>
<BEGIN> he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk , as it struck him , the two identical names , as a striking coincidence . <END>
<BEGIN> by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn , which perceiving , bloom , who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual , plucked the other’s sleeve gently , jocosely remarking : —our lives are in peril tonight . <END>
<BEGIN> beware of the steamroller . <END>
<BEGIN> they thereupon stopped . <END>
<BEGIN> bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas , suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new , a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker , a hipshaker , a blackbuttocker , a taildangler , a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch , busy with his thoughts . <END>
<BEGIN> but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but , as he wisely reflected , you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up . <END>
<BEGIN> he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse , without a second care in the world . <END>
<BEGIN> but even a dog , he reflected , take that mongrel in barney kiernan’s , of the same size , would be a holy horror to face . <END>
<BEGIN> but it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel , ship of the desert , distilling grapes into potheen in his hump . <END>
<BEGIN> nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained , nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees . <END>
<BEGIN> whale with a harpoon hairpin , alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke , chalk a circle for a rooster , tiger my eagle eye . <END>
<BEGIN> these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old . <END>
<BEGIN> —what’s this i was saying ? <END>
<BEGIN> ah , yes ! <END>
<BEGIN> my wife , he intimated , plunging _ in medias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind . <END>
<BEGIN> he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen , image of his mother , which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built . <END>
<BEGIN> still , supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected , it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall’s irish industries , concert on the preceding monday , and aristocracy in general . <END>
<BEGIN> exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _ youth here has end _ by jans pieter sweelinck , a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from . <END>
<BEGIN> even more he liked an old german song of _ johannes jeep _ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens , sweet murderers of men , which boggled bloom a bit : von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten . <END>
<BEGIN> these opening bars he sang and translated _ extempore <END>
<BEGIN> bloom , nodding , said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did . <END>
<BEGIN> a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that , the rarest of boons , which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out , could easily , if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain , command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _ entrée _ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b . <END>
<BEGIN> a . <END>
<BEGIN> ( a huge ad in its way ) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success , being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites , if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he , a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties , hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you . <END>
<BEGIN> it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _ conversaziones _ during the festivities of the christmas season , for choice , causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation , cases of which , as he happened to know , were on record—in fact , without giving the show away , he himself once upon a time , if he cared to , could easily have . <END>
<BEGIN> added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at , going hand in hand with his tuition fees . <END>
<BEGIN> not , he parenthesised , that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time . <END>
<BEGIN> but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped . <END>
<BEGIN> besides , though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree , original music like that , different from the conventional rut , would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their _ genus omne <END>
<BEGIN> yes , beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and , booking ahead , give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house , given a backerup , if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs , so to speak , a big _ if however , with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows . <END>
<BEGIN> and it need not detract from the other by one iota as , being his own master , he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone . <END>
<BEGIN> in fact , he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other , possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort , hung on to him at all . <END>
<BEGIN> the horse was just then . <END>
<BEGIN> and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed ( bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _ fools step in where angels _ principle , advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who , he noticed , was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present , deprecate him , or whatever you like to call it which in bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character , no pun intended . <END>
<BEGIN> the horse having reached the end of his tether , so to speak , halted and , rearing high a proud feathering tail , added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish , three smoking globes of turds . <END>
<BEGIN> slowly three times , one after another , from a full crupper he mired . <END>
<BEGIN> and humanely his driver waited till he ( or she ) had ended , patient in his scythed car . <END>
<BEGIN> side by side bloom , profiting by the _ contretemps with stephen passed through the gap of the chains , divided by the upright , and , stepping over a strand of mire , went across towards gardiner street lower , stephen singing more boldly , but not loudly , the end of the ballad . <END>
<BEGIN> und alle schiffe brücken . <END>
<BEGIN> the driver never said a word , good , bad or indifferent , but merely watched the two figures , as he sat on his lowbacked car , both black , one full , one lean , walk towards the railway bridge , _ to be married by father maher <END>
<BEGIN> as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _ tête à tête _ ( which , of course , he was utterly out of ) about sirens , enemies of man’s reason , mingled with a number of other topics of the same category , usurpers , historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street _ and looked after their lowbacked car <END>
<BEGIN> what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning ? <END>
<BEGIN> starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square , west : then , at reduced pace , each bearing left , gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of temple street : then , at reduced pace with interruptions of halt , bearing right , temple street , north , as far as hardwicke place . <END>
<BEGIN> approaching , disparate , at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before george’s church diametrically , the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends . <END>
<BEGIN> of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary ? <END>
<BEGIN> music , literature , ireland , dublin , paris , friendship , woman , prostitution , diet , the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees , exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets , the roman catholic church , ecclesiastical celibacy , the irish nation , jesuit education , careers , the study of medicine , the past day , the maleficent influence of the presabbath , stephen’s collapse . <END>
<BEGIN> did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience ? <END>
<BEGIN> both were sensitive to artistic impressions , musical in preference to plastic or pictorial . <END>
<BEGIN> both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life , a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence . <END>
<BEGIN> both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious , national , social and ethical doctrines . <END>
<BEGIN> both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism . <END>
<BEGIN> were their views on some points divergent ? <END>
<BEGIN> stephen dissented openly from bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature . <END>
<BEGIN> bloom assented covertly to stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus , son of potitus , son of odyssus , sent by pope celestine i in the year 432 in the reign of leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart ( † 266 <URL> suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree . <END>
<BEGIN> the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength , accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere , stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud ( perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin ) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand . <END>
<BEGIN> was there one point on which their views were equal and negative ? <END>
<BEGIN> the influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees . <END>
<BEGIN> had bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past ? <END>
<BEGIN> in 1884 with owen goldberg and cecil turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between longwood avenue and leonard’s corner and leonard’s corner and synge street and synge street and bloomfield avenue . <END>
<BEGIN> in 1885 with percy apjohn in the evenings , reclined against the wall between gibraltar villa and bloomfield house in crumlin , barony of uppercross . <END>
<BEGIN> in 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps , in front parlours , in third class railway carriages of suburban lines . <END>

<BEGIN> what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884 , 1885 , 1886 , 1888 , 1892 , 1893 , 1904 did bloom make before their arrival at their destination ? <END>
<BEGIN> he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations . <END>
<BEGIN> as in what ways ? <END>
<BEGIN> from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received : existence with existence he was with any as any with any : from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived . <END>
<BEGIN> what act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination ? <END>
<BEGIN> at the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers , number 7 eccles street , he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey . <END>
<BEGIN> was it there ? <END>
<BEGIN> it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding . <END>
<BEGIN> why was he doubly irritated ? <END>
<BEGIN> because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget . <END>
<BEGIN> what were then the alternatives before the , premeditatedly ( respectively ) and inadvertently , keyless couple ? <END>
<BEGIN> to enter or not to enter . <END>
<BEGIN> to knock or not to knock . <END>
<BEGIN> bloom’s decision ? <END>
<BEGIN> a stratagem . <END>
<BEGIN> resting his feet on the dwarf wall , he climbed over the area railings , compressed his hat on his head , grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles , lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall . <END>
<BEGIN> did he fall ? <END>
<BEGIN> by his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure , as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of francis froedman , pharmaceutical chemist of 19 frederick street , north , on the last feast of the ascension , to wit , the twelfth day of may of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era ( jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour , mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo golden number 5 , epact 13 , solar cycle 9 , dominical letters c b , roman indiction 2 , julian period 6617 , mcmiv . <END>
<BEGIN> did he rise uninjured by concussion ? <END>
<BEGIN> regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact , raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum , gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery , ignited a lucifer match by friction , set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock , lit a high flame which , by regulating , he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle . <END>
<BEGIN> what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive ? <END>
<BEGIN> reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 cp , a man lighting a candle of 1 cp , a man removing in turn each of his two boots , a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle . <END>
<BEGIN> did the man reappear elsewhere ? <END>
<BEGIN> after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor . <END>
<BEGIN> the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges . <END>
<BEGIN> in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat , with his candle . <END>
<BEGIN> did stephen obey his sign ? <END>
<BEGIN> yes , entering softly , he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of bloom’s house . <END>
<BEGIN> what did bloom do ? <END>
<BEGIN> he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame , drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone , one for stephen with its back to the area window , the other for himself when necessary , knelt on one knee , composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs flower and m’donald of 14 d’olier street , kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match , thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air . <END>
<BEGIN> of what similar apparitions did stephen think ? <END>
<BEGIN> of others elsewhere in other times who , kneeling on one knee or on two , had kindled fires for him , of brother michael in the infirmary of the college of the society of jesus at clongowes wood , sallins , in the county of kildare : of his father , simon dedalus , in an unfurnished room of his first residence in dublin , number thirteen fitzgibbon street : of his godmother miss kate morkan in the house of her dying sister miss julia morkan at 15 usher’s island : of his aunt sara , wife of richie ( richard ) goulding , in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 clanbrassil street : of his mother mary , wife of simon dedalus , in the kitchen of number twelve north richmond street on the morning of the feast of saint francis xavier 1898 : of the dean of studies , father butt , in the physics’ theatre of university college , 16 stephen’s green , north : of his sister dilly ( delia ) in his father’s house in cabra . <END>
<BEGIN> what did stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall ? <END>
<BEGIN> under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope , stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier , from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction . <END>
<BEGIN> what did bloom see on the range ? <END>
<BEGIN> on the right ( smaller ) hob a blue enamelled saucepan : on the left ( larger ) hob a black iron kettle . <END>
<BEGIN> what did bloom do at the range ? <END>
<BEGIN> he removed the saucepan to the left hob , rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow . <END>
<BEGIN> did it flow ? <END>
<BEGIN> yes . <END>
<BEGIN> from roundwood reservoir in county wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons , percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the dargle , rathdown , glen of the downs and callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at stillorgan , a distance of 22 statute miles , and thence , through a system of relieving tanks , by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at eustace bridge , upper leeson street , though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1 / 2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer , mr spencer harty , c . <URL> on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption ( envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the grand and royal canals as in 1893 ) particularly as the south dublin guardians , notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter , had been convicted of a wastage of 20 , 000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation , mr ignatius rice , solicitor , thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public , selfsupporting taxpayers , solvent , sound . <END>

<BEGIN> what reason did stephen give for declining bloom’s offer ? <END>

<BEGIN> what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing , the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape , stomach and thenar or sole of foot ? <END>
<BEGIN> the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius . <END>
<BEGIN> what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress ? <END>
<BEGIN> dietary : concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon , salt ling and butter , the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed . <END>
<BEGIN> which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest ? <END>
<BEGIN> confidence in himself , an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation . <END>
<BEGIN> what concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire ? <END>
<BEGIN> the phenomenon of ebullition . <END>
<BEGIN> fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue , ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal , containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun , primal source of heat ( radiant transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether . <END>
<BEGIN> heat ( convected a mode of motion developed by such combustion , was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel , being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron , in part reflected , in part absorbed , in part transmitted , gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point , a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° fahrenheit . <END>
<BEGIN> what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature ? <END>
<BEGIN> a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously . <END>
<BEGIN> for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled ? <END>
<BEGIN> to shave himself . <END>
<BEGIN> what advantages attended shaving by night ? <END>
<BEGIN> a softer beard : a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather : a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours : quiet reflections upon the course of the day : a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises , premonitions and perturbations , a clattered milkcan , a postman’s double knock , a paper read , reread while lathering , relathering the same spot , a shock , a shoot , with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered : which was to be done . <END>
<BEGIN> why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise ? <END>
<BEGIN> because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand . <END>
<BEGIN> what quality did it ( his hand ) possess but with what counteracting influence ? <END>

<BEGIN> what reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow ? <END>
<BEGIN> reminiscences of coincidences , truth stranger than fiction , preindicative of the result of the gold cup flat handicap , the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _ evening telegraph late pink edition , in the cabman’s shelter , at butt bridge . <END>

<BEGIN> what qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations ? <END>
<BEGIN> the difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation . <END>
<BEGIN> his mood ? <END>
<BEGIN> he had not risked , he did not expect , he had not been disappointed , he was satisfied . <END>
<BEGIN> what satisfied him ? <END>
<BEGIN> to have sustained no positive loss . <END>
<BEGIN> to have brought a positive gain to others . <END>
<BEGIN> light to the gentiles . <END>
<BEGIN> how did bloom prepare a collation for a gentile ? <END>
<BEGIN> he poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls , four in all , of epps’s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label , to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed . <END>
<BEGIN> what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest ? <END>
<BEGIN> relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation crown derby presented to him by his only daughter , millicent ( milly he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and , in reduced measure , to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion ( molly <END>
<BEGIN> was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality ? <END>
<BEGIN> his attention was directed to them by his host jocosely , and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence epps’s massproduct , the creature cocoa . <END>
<BEGIN> were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed , reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun ? <END>

<BEGIN> a gift to his guest of one of the four lady’s handkerchiefs , if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition . <END>
<BEGIN> who drank more quickly ? <END>
<BEGIN> bloom , having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking , from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted , three sips to his opponent’s one , six to two , nine to three . <END>

<BEGIN> less than he had imagined , more than he had hoped . <END>

<BEGIN> she provided : at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities , anticipating his desires . <END>

<BEGIN> to pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday ( proper ) and friday ( normal ) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess . <END>
<BEGIN> what various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation ? <END>
<BEGIN> for the guest : security of domicile and seclusion of study . <END>
<BEGIN> for the host : rejuvenation of intelligence , vicarious satisfaction . <END>
<BEGIN> for the hostess : disintegration of obsession , acquisition of correct italian pronunciation . <END>
<BEGIN> why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter ? <END>
<BEGIN> because the way to daughter led through mother , the way to mother through daughter . <END>

<BEGIN> what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions ? <END>
<BEGIN> the irreparability of the past : once at a performance of albert hengler’s circus in the rotunda , rutland square , dublin , an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom , solitary , was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he ( bloom ) was his ( the clown’s ) papa . <END>
<BEGIN> the imprevidibility of the future : once in the summer of 1898 he ( bloom ) had marked a florin ( 2 with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by j . and t . davy , family grocers , 1 charlemont mall , grand canal , for circulation on the waters of civic finance , for possible , circuitous or direct , return . <END>
<BEGIN> was the clown bloom’s son ? <END>
<BEGIN> no . <END>
<BEGIN> had bloom’s coin returned ? <END>
<BEGIN> never . <END>
<BEGIN> why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him ? <END>
<BEGIN> because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions , the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity . <END>
<BEGIN> he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible , eliminating these conditions ? <END>
<BEGIN> there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural , as distinct from human law , as integral parts of the human whole : the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance : the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence , the agonies of birth and death : the monotonous menstruation of simian and ( particularly ) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause : inevitable accidents at sea , in mines and factories : certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations , innate lunacy and congenital criminality , decimating epidemics : catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality : seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions : the fact of vital growth , through convulsions of metamorphosis , from infancy through maturity to decay . <END>
<BEGIN> why did he desist from speculation ? <END>
<BEGIN> because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed . <END>
<BEGIN> did stephen participate in his dejection ? <END>
<BEGIN> he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void . <END>
<BEGIN> was this affirmation apprehended by bloom ? <END>
<BEGIN> not verbally . <END>
<BEGIN> substantially . <END>
<BEGIN> what comforted his misapprehension ? <END>
<BEGIN> that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void . <END>
<BEGIN> in what order of precedence , with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected ? <END>

<BEGIN> what did each do at the door of egress ? <END>
<BEGIN> bloom set the candlestick on the floor . <END>
<BEGIN> stephen put the hat on his head . <END>
<BEGIN> for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress ? <END>
<BEGIN> for a cat . <END>
<BEGIN> what spectacle confronted them when they , first the host , then the guest , emerged silently , doubly dark , from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden ? <END>
<BEGIN> the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit . <END>
<BEGIN> with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations ? <END>
<BEGIN> meditations of evolution increasingly vaster : of the moon invisible in incipient lunation , approaching perigee : of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way , discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth : of sirius ( alpha in canis maior ) 10 lightyears ( 57 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 miles ) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet : of arcturus : of the precession of equinoxes : of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained : of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901 : of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules : of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars , in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years , threescore and ten , of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity . <END>
<BEGIN> were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast ? <END>
<BEGIN> of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth : of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth , beneath removable stones , in hives and mounds , of microbes , germs , bacteria , bacilli , spermatozoa : of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead : of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies , themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies , each , in continuity , its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies , dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till , if the progress were carried far enough , nought nowhere was never reached . <END>
<BEGIN> why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result ? <END>
<BEGIN> because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places , <URL> the 9th power of the 9th power of 9 , that , the result having been obtained , 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units , tens , hundreds , thousands , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , millions , tens of millions , hundreds of millions , billions , the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers . <END>
<BEGIN> did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race , given in species , and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer , easier of solution ? <END>
<BEGIN> of a different order of difficulty . <END>
<BEGIN> conscious that the human organism , normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons , when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity , according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage , impeded respiration and vertigo , when proposing this problem for solution , he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian , mercurial , veneral , jovian , saturnian , neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions , though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities , to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity . <END>
<BEGIN> and the problem of possible redemption ? <END>
<BEGIN> the minor was proved by the major . <END>
<BEGIN> which various features of the constellations were in turn considered ? <END>
<BEGIN> the various colours significant of various degrees of vitality ( white , yellow , crimson , vermilion , cinnabar their degrees of brilliancy : their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th : their positions : the waggoner’s star : walsingham way : the chariot of david : the annular cinctures of saturn : the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns : the interdependent gyrations of double suns : the independent synchronous discoveries of galileo , simon marius , piazzi , le verrier , herschel , galle : the systematisations attempted by bode and kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution : the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion : the sidereal origin of meteoric stones : the libyan floods on mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist : the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of s . lawrence ( martyr , 10 august the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms : the posited influence of celestial on human bodies : the appearance of a star ( 1st magnitude ) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day ( a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns ) about the period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of cassiopeia and of a star ( 2nd magnitude ) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of ( presumably ) similar origin which had ( effectively or presumably ) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about the period of the birth of stephen dedalus , and in and from the constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph bloom , junior , and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons : the attendant phenomena of eclipses , solar and lunar , from immersion to emersion , abatement of wind , transit of shadow , taciturnity of winged creatures , emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals , persistence of infernal light , obscurity of terrestrial waters , pallor of human beings . <END>
<BEGIN> his ( bloom’s ) logical conclusion , having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error ? <END>
<BEGIN> that it was not a heaventree , not a heavengrot , not a heavenbeast , not a heavenman . <END>
<BEGIN> that it was a utopia , there being no known method from the known to the unknown : an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes : a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space , remobilised in air : a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence . <END>
<BEGIN> was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle ? <END>
<BEGIN> indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet . <END>
<BEGIN> did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters ? <END>
<BEGIN> it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy : the lake of dreams , the sea of rains , the gulf of dews , the ocean of fecundity . <END>
<BEGIN> what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman ? <END>
<BEGIN> her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations : her nocturnal predominance : her satellitic dependence : her luminary reflection : her constancy under all her phases , rising and setting by her appointed times , waxing and waning : the forced invariability of her aspect : her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation : her potency over effluent and refluent waters : her power to enamour , to mortify , to invest with beauty , to render insane , to incite to and aid delinquency : the tranquil inscrutability of her visage : the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity : her omens of tempest and of calm : the stimulation of her light , her motion and her presence : the admonition of her craters , her arid seas , her silence : her splendour , when visible : her attraction , when invisible . <END>
<BEGIN> what visible luminous sign attracted bloom’s , who attracted stephen’s , gaze ? <END>
<BEGIN> in the second storey ( rere ) of his ( bloom’s ) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by frank o’hara , window blind , curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer , 16 aungier street . <END>
<BEGIN> how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person , his wife marion ( molly ) bloom , denoted by a visible splendid sign , a lamp ? <END>
<BEGIN> with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations : with subdued affection and admiration : with description : with impediment : with suggestion . <END>
<BEGIN> both then were silent ? <END>
<BEGIN> silent , each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces . <END>
<BEGIN> were they indefinitely inactive ? <END>
<BEGIN> at stephen’s suggestion , at bloom’s instigation both , first stephen , then bloom , in penumbra urinated , their sides contiguous , their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition , their gazes , first bloom’s , then stephen’s , elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow . <END>
<BEGIN> similarly ? <END>
<BEGIN> the trajectories of their , first sequent , then simultaneous , urinations were dissimilar : bloom’s longer , less irruent , in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter , who in his ultimate year at high school ( 1880 ) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution , 210 scholars : stephen’s higher , more sibilant , who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure . <END>
<BEGIN> what different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other ? <END>
<BEGIN> to bloom : the problems of irritability , tumescence , rigidity , reactivity , dimension , sanitariness , pilosity . <END>
<BEGIN> to stephen : the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus circumcised ( 1 january , holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work ) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce , the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic church , conserved in calcata , were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails . <END>
<BEGIN> what celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed ? <END>
<BEGIN> a star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the tress of berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo . <END>
<BEGIN> how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer ? <END>
<BEGIN> by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock , obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left , withdrawing a bolt from its staple , pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress . <END>
<BEGIN> how did they take leave , one of the other , in separation ? <END>
<BEGIN> standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base , the lines of their valedictory arms , meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles . <END>
<BEGIN> what sound accompanied the union of their tangent , the disunion of their ( respectively ) centrifugal and centripetal hands ? <END>
<BEGIN> the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of saint george . <END>
<BEGIN> what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard ? <END>
<BEGIN> by stephen : liliata rutilantium . <END>
<BEGIN> turma circumdet . <END>
<BEGIN> iubilantium te virginum . <END>
<BEGIN> chorus excipiat . <END>
<BEGIN> by bloom : heigho , heigho , heigho , heigho . <END>

<BEGIN> the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth , the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane . <END>
<BEGIN> alone , what did bloom feel ? <END>
<BEGIN> the cold of interstellar space , thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of fahrenheit , centigrade or réaumur : the incipient intimations of proximate dawn . <END>
<BEGIN> of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him ? <END>
<BEGIN> of companions now in various manners in different places defunct : percy apjohn ( killed in action , modder river philip gilligan ( phthisis , jervis street hospital matthew f . kane ( accidental drowning , dublin bay philip moisel ( pyemia , heytesbury street michael hart ( phthisis , mater misericordiae hospital patrick dignam ( apoplexy , sandymount <END>
<BEGIN> what prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain ? <END>
<BEGIN> the disparition of three final stars , the diffusion of daybreak , the apparition of a new solar disk . <END>
<BEGIN> had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena ? <END>
<BEGIN> once , in 1887 , after a protracted performance of charades in the house of luke doyle , kimmage , he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon , seated on a wall , his gaze turned in the direction of mizrach , the east . <END>
<BEGIN> he remembered the initial paraphenomena ? <END>
<BEGIN> more active air , a matutinal distant cock , ecclesiastical clocks at various points , avine music , the isolated tread of an early wayfarer , the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body , the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon . <END>
<BEGIN> did he remain ? <END>
<BEGIN> with deep inspiration he returned , retraversing the garden , reentering the passage , reclosing the door . <END>
<BEGIN> with brief suspiration he reassumed the candle , reascended the stairs , reapproached the door of the front room , hallfloor , and reentered . <END>
<BEGIN> what suddenly arrested his ingress ? <END>
<BEGIN> the right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where , an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later , a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered . <END>
<BEGIN> describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture . <END>
<BEGIN> a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack ( an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa : the walnut sideboard ( a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress ) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door : two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table . <END>
<BEGIN> describe them . <END>
<BEGIN> one : a squat stuffed easychair , with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere , which , repelled in recoil , had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration . <END>
<BEGIN> the other : a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves , placed directly opposite the former , its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown , its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush . <END>
<BEGIN> what significances attached to these two chairs ? <END>
<BEGIN> significances of similitude , of posture , of symbolism , of circumstantial evidence , of testimonial supermanence . <END>
<BEGIN> what occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard ? <END>
<BEGIN> a vertical piano ( cadby ) with exposed keyboard , its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches , a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes , its musicrest supporting the music in the key of g natural for voice and piano of _ love’s old sweet song _ ( words by g . clifton bingham , composed by j . l . molloy , sung by madam antoinette sterling ) open at the last page with the final indications _ ad libitum , forte pedal , _ animato sustained pedal , _ ritirando close . <END>
<BEGIN> with what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects ? <END>
<BEGIN> with strain , elevating a candlestick : with pain , feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence : with attention , focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active : with solicitation , bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe : with amusement , remembering dr malachi mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green : with pleasure , repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration . <END>
<BEGIN> his next proceeding ? <END>
<BEGIN> from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone , one inch in height , placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate , placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece , produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus ( illustrated ) entitled agendath netaim , unfolded the same , examined it superficially , rolled it into a thin cylinder , ignited it in the candleflame , applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance , placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion . <END>
<BEGIN> what followed this operation ? <END>
<BEGIN> the truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense . <END>
<BEGIN> what homothetic objects , other than the candlestick , stood on the mantelpiece ? <END>
<BEGIN> a timepiece of striated connemara marble , stopped at the hour of <URL> <URL> on the 21 march 1896 , matrimonial gift of matthew dillon : a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade , matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle : an embalmed owl , matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper . <END>
<BEGIN> what interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and bloom ? <END>
<BEGIN> in the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl . <END>
<BEGIN> before the mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom while bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle . <END>
<BEGIN> what composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention ? <END>
<BEGIN> the image of a solitary ( ipsorelative ) mutable ( aliorelative ) man . <END>

basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2 / 6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give 9 points in 10 to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods _ ave maria _ what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _ o maria santisima _ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1 / 4 after 3 when i saw the 2 dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little chits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _ stabat mater _ by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g 8th bn 2nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11 / 6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6 in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more i have of life up to 35 no im what am i at all ill be 33 in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street 1st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7 wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into 1 of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all

very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c i’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last januarys paper and all those old overcoats i bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend mrs stanhope sent me from the b marche paris what a shame my dearest doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you i sent the

grove with love yrs affly hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at la linea when that matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old i made the scones of course i had everything all to myself then a girl hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when i put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was i then the night of the storm i slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord lytton eugene aram molly bawn she gave me by mrs hungerford on account of the name i dont like books with a molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it o this blanket is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when i was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along i suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few i posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes i could fight with my nails listening to that old arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in holles street the nurse was after

matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the city arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear madam only his letter and the card from milly this morning see she wrote a letter to

<BEGIN> mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s calypso swinging my hat that old bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers god send him sense and me more money i suppose theyre called after him i never thought that would be my name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige m bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well its better than breen or briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them mrs ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom mulvey i wouldnt go mad about either or suppose i divorced him mrs boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the lord knows after the lovely one she had lunita laredo the fun we had running along williss road to europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs i loved looking down at them i was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere i went up windmill hill to the flats that sunday morning with captain rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board i wore that frock from the b marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining i could see over to morocco almost the bay of tangier white and the atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear harry molly darling i was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks i kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else i wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour marie the marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was gardner yes i can see his face cleanshaven frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the

winter its more company o lord it was rotten cold too that winter when i was only about ten was i yes i had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift i had up to heat myself i loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and i in my skin hopping around i used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance i put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow i hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and findon haddy and hot buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their claws i wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as i wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice i bought i think ill get a bit

fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow i hate those ruck of mary ann coalboxes out for the day whit monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation i wonder what kind is that book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose ill have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about 3 weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5 in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _ sweet _ heart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet _ tart _ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 i was married 88 milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at dillons 5 or 6 about 88 i suppose hes 20 or more im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in 1 / 2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only 8 / 6 or 18 / 6 ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want £ 1 or perhaps 30 ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o

pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day

love flowers id love to have the whole place swimming in roses god of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got him to propose to me yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath yes he said i was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes
