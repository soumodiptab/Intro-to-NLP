<BEGIN> pride & prejudice . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter i . <END>
<BEGIN> it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession <END>
<BEGIN> of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . <END>
<BEGIN> however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his <END>
<BEGIN> first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds <END>
<BEGIN> of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful <END>
<BEGIN> property of some one or other of their daughters . <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear mr . bennet said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that <END>
<BEGIN> netherfield park is let at last <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet replied that he had not . <END>
<BEGIN> " but it is returned she ; " for mrs . long has just been here , and she <END>
<BEGIN> told me all about <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet made no answer . <END>
<BEGIN> " do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently . <END>
<BEGIN> you _ want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this was invitation enough . <END>
<BEGIN> " why , my dear , you must know , mrs . long says that netherfield is taken <END>
<BEGIN> by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came <END>
<BEGIN> down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much <END>
<BEGIN> delighted with it that he agreed with mr . morris immediately ; that he is <END>
<BEGIN> to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be <END>
<BEGIN> in the house by the end of next <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " what is his name <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " is he married or single <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! single , my dear , to be sure ! a single man of large fortune ; four <END>
<BEGIN> or five thousand a year . what a fine thing for our girls <END>
<BEGIN> " how so ? how can it affect them <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear mr . bennet replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! you <END>
<BEGIN> must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " is that his design in settling here <END>
<BEGIN> " design ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! but it is very likely that he <END>
<BEGIN> _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as <END>
<BEGIN> soon as he <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i see no occasion for that . you and the girls may go , or you may send <END>
<BEGIN> them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are <END>
<BEGIN> as handsome as any of them , mr . bingley might like you the best of the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear , you flatter me . i certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but <END>
<BEGIN> i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . when a woman has <END>
<BEGIN> five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr . bingley when he comes into <END>
<BEGIN> the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it is more than i engage for , i assure <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but consider your daughters . only think what an establishment it would <END>
<BEGIN> be for one of them . sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , <END>
<BEGIN> merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new <END>
<BEGIN> comers . indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit <END>
<BEGIN> him , if you do <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are over scrupulous surely . i dare say mr . bingley will be very <END>
<BEGIN> glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my <END>
<BEGIN> hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though <END>
<BEGIN> i must throw in a good word for my little <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i desire you will do no such thing . lizzy is not a bit better than the <END>
<BEGIN> others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so <END>
<BEGIN> good humoured as lydia . but you are always giving _ her _ the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " they have none of them much to recommend them replied he ; " they are <END>
<BEGIN> all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of <END>
<BEGIN> quickness than her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " mr . bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? you take <END>
<BEGIN> delight in vexing me . you have no compassion on my poor <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you mistake me , my dear . i have a high respect for your nerves . they <END>
<BEGIN> are my old friends . i have heard you mention them with consideration <END>
<BEGIN> these twenty years at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " ah ! you do not know what i <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four <END>
<BEGIN> thousand a year come into the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not <END>
<BEGIN> visit <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , <END>
<BEGIN> reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had <END>
<BEGIN> been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . _ her _ mind <END>
<BEGIN> was less difficult to develope . she was a woman of mean understanding , <END>
<BEGIN> little information , and uncertain temper . when she was discontented she <END>
<BEGIN> fancied herself nervous . the business of her life was to get her <END>
<BEGIN> daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter ii . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr . bingley . he <END>
<BEGIN> had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his <END>
<BEGIN> wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was <END>
<BEGIN> paid , she had no knowledge of it . it was then disclosed in the following <END>
<BEGIN> manner . observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he <END>
<BEGIN> suddenly addressed her with , <END>
<BEGIN> " i hope mr . bingley will like it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " we are not in a way to know _ what _ mr . bingley likes said her mother <END>
<BEGIN> resentfully , " since we are not to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but you forget , mama said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the <END>
<BEGIN> assemblies , and that mrs . long has promised to introduce <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not believe mrs . long will do any such thing . she has two nieces <END>
<BEGIN> of her own . she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion <END>
<BEGIN> of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no more have i said mr . bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do <END>
<BEGIN> not depend on her serving <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain <END>
<BEGIN> herself , began scolding one of her daughters . <END>
<BEGIN> " don ' t keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! have a little <END>
<BEGIN> compassion on my nerves . you tear them to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father ; " she times <END>
<BEGIN> them <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully . <END>
<BEGIN> " when is your next ball to be , lizzy <END>
<BEGIN> " to morrow <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " aye , so it is cried her mother , " and mrs . long does not come back <END>
<BEGIN> till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , <END>
<BEGIN> for she will not know him <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " impossible , mr . bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him <END>
<BEGIN> myself ; how can you be so teazing <END>
<BEGIN> " i honour your circumspection . a fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly <END>
<BEGIN> very little . one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a <END>
<BEGIN> fortnight . but if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after <END>
<BEGIN> all , mrs . long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as <END>
<BEGIN> she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will <END>
<BEGIN> take it on <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the girls stared at their father . mrs . bennet said only , " nonsense , <END>
<BEGIN> nonsense <END>
<BEGIN> " what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he . " do <END>
<BEGIN> you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on <END>
<BEGIN> them , as nonsense ? i cannot quite agree with you _ there what say you , <END>
<BEGIN> mary ? for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great <END>
<BEGIN> books , and make <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . <END>
<BEGIN> " while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued , " let us return to mr . <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am sick of mr . bingley cried his wife . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am sorry to hear _ that but why did not you tell me so before ? if i <END>
<BEGIN> had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on <END>
<BEGIN> him . it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we <END>
<BEGIN> cannot escape the acquaintance <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy <END>
<BEGIN> was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the <END>
<BEGIN> while . <END>
<BEGIN> " how good it was in you , my dear mr . bennet ! but i knew i should <END>
<BEGIN> persuade you at last . i was sure you loved your girls too well to <END>
<BEGIN> neglect such an acquaintance . well , how pleased i am ! and it is such a <END>
<BEGIN> good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said <END>
<BEGIN> a word about it till <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse said mr . bennet ; and , <END>
<BEGIN> as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . <END>
<BEGIN> " what an excellent father you have , girls said she , when the door was <END>
<BEGIN> shut . " i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; <END>
<BEGIN> or me either , for that matter . at our time of life , it is not so <END>
<BEGIN> pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but <END>
<BEGIN> for your sakes , we would do any thing . lydia , my love , though you _ are _ <END>
<BEGIN> the youngest , i dare say mr . bingley will dance with you at the next <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _ am _ the <END>
<BEGIN> youngest , i ' m the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would <END>
<BEGIN> return mr . bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to <END>
<BEGIN> dinner . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter iii . <END>
<BEGIN> not all that mrs . bennet , however , with the assistance of her five <END>
<BEGIN> daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her <END>
<BEGIN> husband any satisfactory description of mr . bingley . they attacked him <END>
<BEGIN> in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and <END>
<BEGIN> distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at <END>
<BEGIN> last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour <END>
<BEGIN> lady lucas . her report was highly favourable . sir william had been <END>
<BEGIN> delighted with him . he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely <END>
<BEGIN> agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly <END>
<BEGIN> with a large party . nothing could be more delightful ! to be fond of <END>
<BEGIN> dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively <END>
<BEGIN> hopes of mr . bingley ' s heart were entertained . <END>
<BEGIN> " if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> said mrs . bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well <END>
<BEGIN> married , i shall have nothing to wish <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> in a few days mr . bingley returned mr . bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten <END>
<BEGIN> minutes with him in his library . he had entertained hopes of being <END>
<BEGIN> admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard <END>
<BEGIN> much ; but he saw only the father . the ladies were somewhat more <END>
<BEGIN> fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper <END>
<BEGIN> window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse . <END>
<BEGIN> an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her <END>
<BEGIN> housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . mr . bingley <END>
<BEGIN> was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to <END>
<BEGIN> accept the honour of their invitation , & c . mrs . bennet was quite <END>
<BEGIN> disconcerted . she could not imagine what business he could have in town <END>
<BEGIN> so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that <END>
<BEGIN> he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never <END>
<BEGIN> settled at netherfield as he ought to be . lady lucas quieted her fears a <END>
<BEGIN> little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a <END>
<BEGIN> large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr . bingley <END>
<BEGIN> was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . <END>
<BEGIN> the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the <END>
<BEGIN> day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought <END>
<BEGIN> only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . and when <END>
<BEGIN> the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five <END>
<BEGIN> altogether ; mr . bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and <END>
<BEGIN> another young man . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant <END>
<BEGIN> countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . his sisters were fine women , <END>
<BEGIN> with an air of decided fashion . his brother in - law , mr . hurst , merely <END>
<BEGIN> looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr . darcy soon drew the attention <END>
<BEGIN> of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and <END>
<BEGIN> the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after <END>
<BEGIN> his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . the gentlemen <END>
<BEGIN> pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was <END>
<BEGIN> much handsomer than mr . bingley , and he was looked at with great <END>
<BEGIN> admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust <END>
<BEGIN> which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be <END>
<BEGIN> proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his <END>
<BEGIN> large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most <END>
<BEGIN> forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared <END>
<BEGIN> with his friend . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal <END>
<BEGIN> people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , <END>
<BEGIN> was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one <END>
<BEGIN> himself at netherfield . such amiable qualities must speak for <END>
<BEGIN> themselves . what a contrast between him and his friend ! mr . darcy danced <END>
<BEGIN> only once with mrs . hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being <END>
<BEGIN> introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in <END>
<BEGIN> walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . <END>
<BEGIN> his character was decided . he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in <END>
<BEGIN> the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . <END>
<BEGIN> amongst the most violent against him was mrs . bennet , whose dislike of <END>
<BEGIN> his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his <END>
<BEGIN> having slighted one of her daughters . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit <END>
<BEGIN> down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr . darcy had been <END>
<BEGIN> standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his <END>
<BEGIN> friend to join it . <END>
<BEGIN> " come , darcy said he , " i must have you dance . i hate to see you <END>
<BEGIN> standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . you had much better <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i certainly shall not . you know how i detest it , unless i am <END>
<BEGIN> particularly acquainted with my partner . at such an assembly as this , it <END>
<BEGIN> would be insupportable . your sisters are engaged , and there is not <END>
<BEGIN> another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to <END>
<BEGIN> stand up <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley , " for a <END>
<BEGIN> kingdom ! upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my <END>
<BEGIN> life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see <END>
<BEGIN> uncommonly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> you _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! but there is one <END>
<BEGIN> of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i <END>
<BEGIN> dare say , very agreeable . do let me ask my partner to introduce <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " which do you mean and turning round , he looked for a moment at <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , <END>
<BEGIN> " she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _ me and i am in no <END>
<BEGIN> humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted <END>
<BEGIN> by other men . you had better return to your partner and enjoy her <END>
<BEGIN> smiles , for you are wasting your time with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley followed his advice . mr . darcy walked off ; and elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . she told the story <END>
<BEGIN> however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , <END>
<BEGIN> playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . <END>
<BEGIN> the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> party . mr . bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been <END>
<BEGIN> distinguished by his sisters . jane was as much gratified by this , as her <END>
<BEGIN> mother could be , though in a quieter way . elizabeth felt jane ' s <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure . mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most <END>
<BEGIN> accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been <END>
<BEGIN> fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they <END>
<BEGIN> had yet learnt to care for at a ball . they returned therefore in good <END>
<BEGIN> spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they <END>
<BEGIN> were the principal inhabitants . they found mr . bennet still up . with a <END>
<BEGIN> book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a <END>
<BEGIN> good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised <END>
<BEGIN> such splendid expectations . he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s <END>
<BEGIN> views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he <END>
<BEGIN> had a very different story to hear . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! my dear mr . bennet as she entered the room , " we have had a most <END>
<BEGIN> delightful evening , a most excellent ball . i wish you had been there . <END>
<BEGIN> jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . every body said how well <END>
<BEGIN> she looked ; and mr . bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with <END>
<BEGIN> her twice . only think of _ that _ my dear ; he actually danced with her <END>
<BEGIN> twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second <END>
<BEGIN> time . first of all , he asked miss lucas . i was so vexed to see him stand <END>
<BEGIN> up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody <END>
<BEGIN> can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going <END>
<BEGIN> down the dance . so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and <END>
<BEGIN> asked her for the two next . then , the two third he danced with miss <END>
<BEGIN> king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane <END>
<BEGIN> again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger <END>
<BEGIN> " if he had had any compassion for _ me cried her husband impatiently , <END>
<BEGIN> " he would not have danced half so much ! for god ' s sake , say no more of <END>
<BEGIN> his partners . oh ! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! my dear continued mrs . bennet , " i am quite delighted with him . he <END>
<BEGIN> is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women . i never <END>
<BEGIN> in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses . i dare say the <END>
<BEGIN> lace upon mrs . hurst ' s gown <END>
<BEGIN> here she was interrupted again . mr . bennet protested against any <END>
<BEGIN> description of finery . she was therefore obliged to seek another branch <END>
<BEGIN> of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <END>
<BEGIN> exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr . darcy . <END>
<BEGIN> " but i can assure you she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not <END>
<BEGIN> suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at <END>
<BEGIN> all worth pleasing . so high and so conceited that there was no enduring <END>
<BEGIN> him ! he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very <END>
<BEGIN> great ! not handsome enough to dance with ! i wish you had been there , my <END>
<BEGIN> dear , to have given him one of your set downs . i quite detest the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> chapter iv . <END>
<BEGIN> when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in <END>
<BEGIN> her praise of mr . bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much <END>
<BEGIN> she admired him . <END>
<BEGIN> " he is just what a young man ought to be said she , " sensible , good <END>
<BEGIN> humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners so much ease , <END>
<BEGIN> with such perfect good breeding <END>
<BEGIN> " he is also handsome replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought <END>
<BEGIN> likewise to be , if he possibly can . his character is thereby <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . i <END>
<BEGIN> did not expect such a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " did not you ? _ i _ did for you . but that is one great difference between <END>
<BEGIN> us . compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . what <END>
<BEGIN> could be more natural than his asking you again ? he could not help <END>
<BEGIN> seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in <END>
<BEGIN> the room . no thanks to his gallantry for that . well , he certainly is <END>
<BEGIN> very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him . you have liked many a <END>
<BEGIN> stupider <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " dear lizzy <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general . <END>
<BEGIN> you never see a fault in any body . all the world are good and agreeable <END>
<BEGIN> in your eyes . i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak <END>
<BEGIN> what i <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i know you do ; and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . with _ your _ <END>
<BEGIN> good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of <END>
<BEGIN> others ! affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every <END>
<BEGIN> where . but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good <END>
<BEGIN> of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of <END>
<BEGIN> the bad belongs to you alone . and so , you like this man ' s sisters too , <END>
<BEGIN> do you ? their manners are not equal to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " certainly not ; at first . but they are very pleasing women when you <END>
<BEGIN> converse with them . miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep <END>
<BEGIN> his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming <END>
<BEGIN> neighbour in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at <END>
<BEGIN> the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more <END>
<BEGIN> quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and <END>
<BEGIN> with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very <END>
<BEGIN> little disposed to approve them . they were in fact very fine ladies ; not <END>
<BEGIN> deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of <END>
<BEGIN> being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . they were <END>
<BEGIN> rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private <END>
<BEGIN> seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the <END>
<BEGIN> habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people <END>
<BEGIN> of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of <END>
<BEGIN> themselves , and meanly of others . they were of a respectable family in <END>
<BEGIN> the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their <END>
<BEGIN> memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been <END>
<BEGIN> acquired by trade . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred <END>
<BEGIN> thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , <END>
<BEGIN> but did not live to do <URL> bingley intended it likewise , and <END>
<BEGIN> sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a <END>
<BEGIN> good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those <END>
<BEGIN> who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <END>
<BEGIN> remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to <END>
<BEGIN> purchase . <END>
<BEGIN> his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but <END>
<BEGIN> though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no <END>
<BEGIN> means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs . hurst , who had <END>
<BEGIN> married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider <END>
<BEGIN> his house as her home when it suited her . mr . bingley had not been of <END>
<BEGIN> age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to <END>
<BEGIN> look at netherfield house . he did look at it and into it for half an <END>
<BEGIN> hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied <END>
<BEGIN> with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . <END>
<BEGIN> between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a <END>
<BEGIN> great opposition of <URL> was endeared to darcy by the <END>
<BEGIN> easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could <END>
<BEGIN> offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never <END>
<BEGIN> appeared dissatisfied . on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the <END>
<BEGIN> firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . in <END>
<BEGIN> understanding darcy was the superior . bingley was by no means deficient , <END>
<BEGIN> but darcy was clever . he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and <END>
<BEGIN> fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . in <END>
<BEGIN> that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . bingley was sure of <END>
<BEGIN> being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence . <END>
<BEGIN> the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently <END>
<BEGIN> characteristic . bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier <END>
<BEGIN> girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , <END>
<BEGIN> there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted <END>
<BEGIN> with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel <END>
<BEGIN> more beautiful . darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people <END>
<BEGIN> in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had <END>
<BEGIN> felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure . miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too <END>
<BEGIN> much . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired <END>
<BEGIN> her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom <END>
<BEGIN> they should not object to know more of . miss bennet was therefore <END>
<BEGIN> established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such <END>
<BEGIN> commendation to think of her as he chose . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter v . <END>
<BEGIN> within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets <END>
<BEGIN> were particularly intimate . sir william lucas had been formerly in trade <END>
<BEGIN> in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the <END>
<BEGIN> honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty . <END>
<BEGIN> the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . it had given him a <END>
<BEGIN> disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and <END>
<BEGIN> quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a <END>
<BEGIN> mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he <END>
<BEGIN> could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by <END>
<BEGIN> business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . for <END>
<BEGIN> though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the <END>
<BEGIN> contrary , he was all attention to every body . by nature inoffensive , <END>
<BEGIN> friendly and obliging , his presentation at st . james ' s had made him <END>
<BEGIN> courteous . <END>
<BEGIN> lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a <END>
<BEGIN> valuable neighbour to mrs . <URL> had several children . the <END>
<BEGIN> eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , <END>
<BEGIN> was elizabeth ' s intimate friend . <END>
<BEGIN> that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a <END>
<BEGIN> ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly <END>
<BEGIN> brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate . <END>
<BEGIN> you _ began the evening well , charlotte said mrs . bennet with civil <END>
<BEGIN> self command to miss lucas . you _ were mr . bingley ' s first <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes but he seemed to like his second <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh you mean jane , i suppose because he danced with her twice . to be <END>
<BEGIN> sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he <END>
<BEGIN> _ did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something <END>
<BEGIN> about mr . <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr . robinson ; did not <END>
<BEGIN> i mention it to you ? mr . robinson ' s asking him how he liked our meryton <END>
<BEGIN> assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty <END>
<BEGIN> women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his <END>
<BEGIN> answering immediately to the last question oh ! the eldest miss bennet <END>
<BEGIN> beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " upon my word well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as <END>
<BEGIN> if but however , it may all come to nothing you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> my _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours eliza said <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte . " mr . darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , <END>
<BEGIN> is he poor eliza to be only just <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i beg you would not put it into lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his <END>
<BEGIN> ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite <END>
<BEGIN> a misfortune to be liked by him . mrs . long told me last night that he <END>
<BEGIN> sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " are you quite sure , ma ' am is not there a little mistake said <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> certainly saw mr . darcy speaking to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he <END>
<BEGIN> could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at <END>
<BEGIN> being spoke <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " miss bingley told me said jane , " that he never speaks much unless <END>
<BEGIN> among his intimate acquaintance . with _ them _ he is remarkably <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not believe a word of it , my dear . if he had been so very <END>
<BEGIN> agreeable he would have talked to mrs . long . but i can guess how it was ; <END>
<BEGIN> every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had <END>
<BEGIN> heard somehow that mrs . long does not keep a carriage , and had come to <END>
<BEGIN> the ball in a hack <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not mind his not talking to mrs . long said miss lucas , " but i <END>
<BEGIN> wish he had danced with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " another time , lizzy said her mother , " i would not dance with _ him <END>
<BEGIN> if i were <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i believe , ma ' am , i may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " his pride said miss lucas , " does not offend _ me _ so much as pride <END>
<BEGIN> often does , because there is an excuse for it . one cannot wonder that so <END>
<BEGIN> very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , <END>
<BEGIN> should think highly of himself . if i may so express it , he has a _ right _ <END>
<BEGIN> to be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is very true replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive <END>
<BEGIN> _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " pride observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her <END>
<BEGIN> reflections , " is a very common failing i believe . by all that i have <END>
<BEGIN> ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human <END>
<BEGIN> nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us <END>
<BEGIN> who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some <END>
<BEGIN> quality or other , real or imaginary . vanity and pride are different <END>
<BEGIN> things , though the words are often used synonimously . a person may be <END>
<BEGIN> proud without being vain . pride relates more to our opinion of <END>
<BEGIN> ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if i were as rich as mr . darcy cried a young lucas who came with his <END>
<BEGIN> sisters , " i should not care how proud i was . i would keep a pack of <END>
<BEGIN> foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet ; " and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she <END>
<BEGIN> would , and the argument ended only with the visit . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter vi . <END>
<BEGIN> the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield . the visit <END>
<BEGIN> was returned in due form . miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the <END>
<BEGIN> good will of mrs . hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was <END>
<BEGIN> found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a <END>
<BEGIN> wish of being better acquainted with _ them was expressed towards the <END>
<BEGIN> two eldest . by jane this attention was received with the greatest <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of <END>
<BEGIN> every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; <END>
<BEGIN> though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in <END>
<BEGIN> all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration . it was <END>
<BEGIN> generally evident whenever they met , that he _ did _ admire her ; and to <END>
<BEGIN> _ her _ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference <END>
<BEGIN> which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a <END>
<BEGIN> way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it <END>
<BEGIN> was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane <END>
<BEGIN> united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a <END>
<BEGIN> uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the <END>
<BEGIN> suspicions of the impertinent . she mentioned this to her friend miss <END>
<BEGIN> lucas . <END>
<BEGIN> " it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte , " to be able to impose <END>
<BEGIN> on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be <END>
<BEGIN> so very guarded . if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill <END>
<BEGIN> from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and <END>
<BEGIN> it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the <END>
<BEGIN> dark . there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every <END>
<BEGIN> attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . we can all <END>
<BEGIN> _ begin _ freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are <END>
<BEGIN> very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without <END>
<BEGIN> encouragement . in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _ more _ <END>
<BEGIN> affection than she feels . bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he <END>
<BEGIN> may never do more than like her , if she does not help him <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . if _ i _ can <END>
<BEGIN> perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to <END>
<BEGIN> discover it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ' s disposition as you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal <END>
<BEGIN> it , he must find it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . but though bingley and jane <END>
<BEGIN> meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they <END>
<BEGIN> always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that <END>
<BEGIN> every moment should be employed in conversing together . jane should <END>
<BEGIN> therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his <END>
<BEGIN> attention . when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling <END>
<BEGIN> in love as much as she <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " your plan is a good one replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in <END>
<BEGIN> question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined <END>
<BEGIN> to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it . but <END>
<BEGIN> these are not jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design . as yet , she <END>
<BEGIN> cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its <END>
<BEGIN> reasonableness . she has known him only a fortnight . she danced four <END>
<BEGIN> dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , <END>
<BEGIN> and has since dined in company with him four times . this is not quite <END>
<BEGIN> enough to make her understand his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " not as you represent it . had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might <END>
<BEGIN> only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must <END>
<BEGIN> remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four <END>
<BEGIN> evenings may do a great <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both <END>
<BEGIN> like vingt un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other <END>
<BEGIN> leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " well said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if <END>
<BEGIN> she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a <END>
<BEGIN> chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a <END>
<BEGIN> twelvemonth . happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . if <END>
<BEGIN> the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or <END>
<BEGIN> ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the <END>
<BEGIN> least . they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to <END>
<BEGIN> have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as <END>
<BEGIN> possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound . you know it is not <END>
<BEGIN> sound , and that you would never act in this way <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> occupied in observing mr . bingley ' s attentions to her sister , elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some <END>
<BEGIN> interest in the eyes of his friend . mr . darcy had at first scarcely <END>
<BEGIN> allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the <END>
<BEGIN> ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . but no <END>
<BEGIN> sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had <END>
<BEGIN> hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered <END>
<BEGIN> uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . to <END>
<BEGIN> this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . though he had <END>
<BEGIN> detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry <END>
<BEGIN> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and <END>
<BEGIN> pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those <END>
<BEGIN> of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . of <END>
<BEGIN> this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made <END>
<BEGIN> himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough <END>
<BEGIN> to dance with . <END>
<BEGIN> he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing <END>
<BEGIN> with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . his doing so <END>
<BEGIN> drew her notice . it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were <END>
<BEGIN> assembled . <END>
<BEGIN> " what does mr . darcy mean said she to charlotte , " by listening to my <END>
<BEGIN> conversation with colonel forster <END>
<BEGIN> " that is a question which mr . darcy only can <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see <END>
<BEGIN> what he is about . he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by <END>
<BEGIN> being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have <END>
<BEGIN> any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such <END>
<BEGIN> a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she <END>
<BEGIN> turned to him and said , <END>
<BEGIN> " did not you think , mr . darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well <END>
<BEGIN> just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at <END>
<BEGIN> meryton <END>
<BEGIN> " with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are severe on <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it will be _ her _ turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas . " i am going <END>
<BEGIN> to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me <END>
<BEGIN> to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken <END>
<BEGIN> a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would <END>
<BEGIN> really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of <END>
<BEGIN> hearing the very best <URL> on miss lucas ' s persevering , however , <END>
<BEGIN> she added , " very well ; if it must be so , it <URL> and gravely glancing <END>
<BEGIN> at mr . darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of <END>
<BEGIN> course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i <END>
<BEGIN> shall keep mine to swell my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital . after a song <END>
<BEGIN> or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she <END>
<BEGIN> would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her <END>
<BEGIN> sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in <END>
<BEGIN> the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always <END>
<BEGIN> impatient for display . <END>
<BEGIN> mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her <END>
<BEGIN> application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited <END>
<BEGIN> manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she <END>
<BEGIN> had reached . elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with <END>
<BEGIN> much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the <END>
<BEGIN> end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by <END>
<BEGIN> scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with <END>
<BEGIN> some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing <END>
<BEGIN> at one end of the room . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of <END>
<BEGIN> passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too <END>
<BEGIN> much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas <END>
<BEGIN> was his neighbour , till sir william thus began . <END>
<BEGIN> " what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr . darcy there <END>

<BEGIN> sir william only smiled . " your friend performs delightfully he <END>
<BEGIN> continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt <END>
<BEGIN> not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr . <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . do <END>
<BEGIN> you often dance at st . james ' s <END>
<BEGIN> " never , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place <END>
<BEGIN> " it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you have a house in town , i conclude <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy bowed . <END>
<BEGIN> " i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of <END>
<BEGIN> superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of <END>
<BEGIN> london would agree with lady <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to <END>
<BEGIN> make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was <END>
<BEGIN> struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to <END>
<BEGIN> her , <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing mr . darcy , you must allow <END>
<BEGIN> me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr . darcy , who , though <END>
<BEGIN> extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly <END>
<BEGIN> drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of <URL> entreat you <END>
<BEGIN> not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her <END>
<BEGIN> hand ; but in vain . elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all <END>
<BEGIN> shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . <END>
<BEGIN> " you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me <END>
<BEGIN> the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the <END>
<BEGIN> amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us <END>

<BEGIN> " he is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we <END>
<BEGIN> cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a <END>
<BEGIN> partner <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . her resistance had not <END>
<BEGIN> injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some <END>
<BEGIN> complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , <END>
<BEGIN> " i can guess the subject of your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i should imagine <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings <END>
<BEGIN> in this manner in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion . <END>
<BEGIN> i was never more annoyed ! the insipidity and yet the noise ; the <END>
<BEGIN> nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would <END>
<BEGIN> i give to hear your strictures on them <END>

<BEGIN> agreeably engaged . i have been meditating on the very great pleasure <END>
<BEGIN> which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he <END>
<BEGIN> would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy replied with great intrepidity , <END>
<BEGIN> " miss elizabeth <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley . " i am all astonishment . <END>
<BEGIN> how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you <END>
<BEGIN> joy <END>
<BEGIN> " that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask . a lady ' s <END>
<BEGIN> imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love <END>
<BEGIN> to matrimony in a moment . i knew you would be wishing me <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as <END>
<BEGIN> absolutely settled . you will have a charming mother in - law , indeed , and <END>
<BEGIN> of course she will be always at pemberley with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to <END>
<BEGIN> entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her <END>
<BEGIN> that all was safe , her wit flowed long . <END>

<BEGIN> mr . bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two <END>
<BEGIN> thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in <END>
<BEGIN> default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s <END>
<BEGIN> fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply <END>
<BEGIN> the deficiency of his . her father had been an attorney in meryton , and <END>
<BEGIN> had left her four thousand pounds . <END>
<BEGIN> she had a sister married to a mr . philips , who had been a clerk to their <END>
<BEGIN> father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in <END>
<BEGIN> london in a respectable line of trade . <END>
<BEGIN> the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most <END>
<BEGIN> convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted <END>
<BEGIN> thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and <END>
<BEGIN> to a milliner ' s shop just over the way . the two youngest of the family , <END>
<BEGIN> catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; <END>
<BEGIN> their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing <END>
<BEGIN> better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning <END>
<BEGIN> hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news <END>
<BEGIN> the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some <END>
<BEGIN> from their aunt . at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with <END>
<BEGIN> news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the <END>
<BEGIN> head quarters . <END>
<BEGIN> their visits to mrs . philips were now productive of the most interesting <END>
<BEGIN> intelligence . every day added something to their knowledge of the <END>
<BEGIN> officers ' names and connections . their lodgings were not long a secret , <END>
<BEGIN> and at length they began to know the officers themselves . mr . philips <END>
<BEGIN> visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity <END>
<BEGIN> unknown before . they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their <END>
<BEGIN> mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of <END>
<BEGIN> an ensign . <END>
<BEGIN> after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet coolly observed , <END>
<BEGIN> " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two <END>
<BEGIN> of the silliest girls in the country . i have suspected it some time , but <END>
<BEGIN> i am now <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect <END>
<BEGIN> indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and <END>
<BEGIN> her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the <END>
<BEGIN> next morning to london . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am astonished , my dear said mrs . bennet , " that you should be so <END>
<BEGIN> ready to think your own children silly . if i wished to think slightingly <END>

<BEGIN> " this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree . i <END>
<BEGIN> had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must <END>
<BEGIN> so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear mr . bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of <END>
<BEGIN> their father and <URL> they get to our age i dare say they will <END>
<BEGIN> not think about officers any more than we do . i remember the time when i <END>
<BEGIN> liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart ; <END>
<BEGIN> and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should <END>
<BEGIN> want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel <END>
<BEGIN> forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his <END>

<BEGIN> " mama cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain <END>
<BEGIN> carter do not go so often to miss watson ' s as they did when they first <END>
<BEGIN> came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke ' s <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a <END>
<BEGIN> note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited <END>
<BEGIN> for an answer . mrs . bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was <END>
<BEGIN> eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , <END>
<BEGIN> " well , jane , who is it from ? what is it about ? what does he say ? well , <END>
<BEGIN> jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it is from miss bingley said jane , and then read it aloud . <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear friend , <END>
<BEGIN> " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and <END>
<BEGIN> me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our <END>
<BEGIN> lives , for a whole day ' s tête à - tête between two women can never <END>
<BEGIN> end without a quarrel . come as soon as you can on the receipt of <END>
<BEGIN> this . my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . <END>

<BEGIN> " dining out said mrs . bennet , " that is very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " can i have the carriage said jane . <END>
<BEGIN> " no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to <END>
<BEGIN> rain ; and then you must stay all <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that would be a good scheme said elizabeth , " if you were sure that <END>
<BEGIN> they would not offer to send her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! but the gentlemen will have mr . bingley ' s chaise to go to meryton ; <END>
<BEGIN> and the hursts have no horses to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i had much rather go in the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure . they are <END>
<BEGIN> wanted in the farm , mr . bennet , are not they <END>
<BEGIN> " they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but if you have got them to day said elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose <END>
<BEGIN> will be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses <END>
<BEGIN> were engaged . jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her <END>
<BEGIN> mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad <END>
<BEGIN> day . her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it <END>
<BEGIN> rained hard . her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was <END>
<BEGIN> delighted . the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; <END>
<BEGIN> jane certainly could not come back . <END>
<BEGIN> " this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed said mrs . bennet , more than <END>
<BEGIN> once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . till the next <END>
<BEGIN> morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her <END>
<BEGIN> contrivance . breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> brought the following note for elizabeth : <END>
<BEGIN> " my dearest lizzy , <END>
<BEGIN> " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be <END>
<BEGIN> imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . my kind friends will <END>
<BEGIN> not hear of my returning home till i am better . they insist also on <END>
<BEGIN> my seeing mr . jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear <END>
<BEGIN> of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache <END>
<BEGIN> there is not much the matter with me . <END>
<BEGIN> " yours , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " well , my dear said mr . bennet , when elizabeth had read the note <END>
<BEGIN> aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she <END>
<BEGIN> should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley , and under your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! i am not at all afraid of her dying . people do not die of little <END>
<BEGIN> trifling colds . she will be taken good care of . as long as she stays <END>
<BEGIN> there , it is all very well . i would go and see her , if i could have the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though <END>
<BEGIN> the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking <END>
<BEGIN> was her only alternative . she declared her resolution . <END>
<BEGIN> " how can you be so silly cried her mother , " as to think of such a <END>
<BEGIN> thing , in all this dirt ! you will not be fit to be seen when you get <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " is this a hint to me , lizzy said her father , " to send for the <END>
<BEGIN> horses <END>
<BEGIN> " no , indeed . i do not wish to avoid the walk . the distance is nothing , <END>
<BEGIN> when one has a motive ; only three miles . i shall be back by <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary , " but every <END>
<BEGIN> impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , <END>
<BEGIN> exertion should always be in proportion to what is <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> accepted their company , and the three young ladies set <END>
<BEGIN> off together . <END>
<BEGIN> " if we make haste said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may <END>
<BEGIN> see something of captain carter before he <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one <END>
<BEGIN> of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing <END>
<BEGIN> field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing <END>
<BEGIN> over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within <END>
<BEGIN> view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face <END>
<BEGIN> glowing with the warmth of exercise . <END>
<BEGIN> she was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but jane were <END>
<BEGIN> assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> she should have walked three miles so early in the day , <END>
<BEGIN> in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her <END>
<BEGIN> in contempt for it . she was received , however , very politely by them ; <END>
<BEGIN> and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than <END>
<BEGIN> politeness ; there was good humour and <URL> darcy said very <END>
<BEGIN> little , and mr . hurst nothing at all . the former was divided between <END>
<BEGIN> admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , <END>
<BEGIN> and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone . the <END>
<BEGIN> latter was thinking only of his breakfast . <END>
<BEGIN> her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . miss <END>
<BEGIN> bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well <END>
<BEGIN> enough to leave her room . elizabeth was glad to be taken to her <END>
<BEGIN> immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving <END>
<BEGIN> alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed <END>
<BEGIN> for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . she was not equal , <END>
<BEGIN> however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , <END>
<BEGIN> could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the <END>
<BEGIN> extraordinary kindness she was treated with . elizabeth silently attended <END>
<BEGIN> her . <END>
<BEGIN> when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and <END>
<BEGIN> solicitude they shewed for jane . the apothecary came , and having <END>
<BEGIN> examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a <END>
<BEGIN> violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; <END>
<BEGIN> advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . the advice <END>
<BEGIN> was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head <END>
<BEGIN> ached acutely . elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were <END>
<BEGIN> the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact <END>
<BEGIN> nothing to do elsewhere . <END>
<BEGIN> when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very <END>
<BEGIN> unwillingly said so . miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only <END>
<BEGIN> wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern <END>
<BEGIN> in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer <END>
<BEGIN> of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the <END>
<BEGIN> present . elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was <END>
<BEGIN> dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring <END>
<BEGIN> back a supply of clothes . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter viii . <END>
<BEGIN> at five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was summoned to dinner . to the civil enquiries which then <END>
<BEGIN> poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the <END>
<BEGIN> much superior solicitude of mr . bingley ' s , she could not make a very <END>
<BEGIN> favourable answer . jane was by no means better . the sisters , on hearing <END>
<BEGIN> this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how <END>
<BEGIN> shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked <END>
<BEGIN> being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their <END>
<BEGIN> indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . <END>
<BEGIN> their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could <END>
<BEGIN> regard with any complacency . his anxiety for jane was evident , and his <END>
<BEGIN> attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling <END>
<BEGIN> herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the <END>
<BEGIN> others . she had very little notice from any but him . miss bingley was <END>
<BEGIN> engrossed by mr . darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr . <END>
<BEGIN> hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to <END>
<BEGIN> eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish <END>
<BEGIN> to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . <END>
<BEGIN> when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley <END>
<BEGIN> began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . her manners were <END>
<BEGIN> pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; <END>
<BEGIN> she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty . mrs . hurst <END>
<BEGIN> thought the same , and added , <END>
<BEGIN> " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent <END>
<BEGIN> walker . i shall never forget her appearance this morning . she really <END>
<BEGIN> looked almost <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " she did indeed , louisa . i could hardly keep my countenance . very <END>
<BEGIN> nonsensical to come at all ! why must _ she _ be scampering about the <END>
<BEGIN> country , because her sister had a cold ? her hair so untidy , so blowsy <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep <END>
<BEGIN> in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to <END>
<BEGIN> hide it , not doing its <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " your picture may be very exact , louisa said bingley ; " but this was <END>
<BEGIN> all lost upon me . i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably <END>
<BEGIN> well , when she came into the room this morning . her dirty petticoat <END>
<BEGIN> quite escaped my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> you _ observed it , mr . darcy , i am sure said miss bingley ; " and i am <END>
<BEGIN> inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such <END>
<BEGIN> an <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " certainly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , <END>
<BEGIN> above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by <END>
<BEGIN> it ? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , <END>
<BEGIN> a most country town indifference to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said <END>
<BEGIN> bingley . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am afraid , mr . darcy observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , <END>
<BEGIN> " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " not at all he replied ; " they were brightened by the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> short pause followed this speech , and mrs . hurst began again . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet <END>
<BEGIN> girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled . but with such <END>
<BEGIN> a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no <END>
<BEGIN> chance of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is capital added her sister , and they both laughed heartily . <END>
<BEGIN> " if they had uncles enough to fill _ all _ cheapside cried bingley , " it <END>
<BEGIN> would not make them one jot less <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any <END>
<BEGIN> consideration in the world replied darcy . <END>
<BEGIN> to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their <END>
<BEGIN> hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of <END>
<BEGIN> their dear friend ' s vulgar relations . <END>
<BEGIN> with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on <END>
<BEGIN> leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . <END>
<BEGIN> she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till <END>
<BEGIN> late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and <END>
<BEGIN> when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go <END>
<BEGIN> down stairs herself . on entering the drawing room she found the whole <END>
<BEGIN> party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting <END>
<BEGIN> them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the <END>
<BEGIN> excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay <END>
<BEGIN> below with a book . mr . hurst looked at her with astonishment . <END>
<BEGIN> " do you prefer reading to cards said he ; " that is rather <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " miss eliza bennet said miss bingley , " despises cards . she is a great <END>
<BEGIN> reader and has no pleasure in anything <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth ; " i am <END>
<BEGIN> _ not _ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley ; " and <END>
<BEGIN> i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table <END>
<BEGIN> where a few books were lying . he immediately offered to fetch her <END>
<BEGIN> others ; all that his library afforded . <END>
<BEGIN> " and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own <END>
<BEGIN> credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more <END>
<BEGIN> than i ever look <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those <END>
<BEGIN> in the room . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am astonished said miss bingley , " that my father should have left <END>
<BEGIN> so small a collection of <URL> a delightful library you have at <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley , mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> " it ought to be good he replied , " it has been the work of many <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " neglect ! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of <END>
<BEGIN> that noble place . charles , when you build _ your _ house , i wish it may be <END>
<BEGIN> half as delightful as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i wish it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model . there is not a <END>
<BEGIN> finer county in england than <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am talking of possibilities , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley by purchase than by <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little <END>
<BEGIN> attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near <END>
<BEGIN> the card table , and stationed herself between mr . bingley and his eldest <END>
<BEGIN> sister , to observe the game . <END>
<BEGIN> " is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley ; " will <END>
<BEGIN> she be as tall as i am <END>
<BEGIN> " i think she will . she is now about miss elizabeth bennet ' s height , or <END>
<BEGIN> rather <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " how i long to see her again ! i never met with anybody who delighted me <END>
<BEGIN> so much . such a countenance , such manners ! and so extremely <END>
<BEGIN> accomplished for her age ! her performance on the piano forte is <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it is amazing to me said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience <END>
<BEGIN> to be so very accomplished , as they all <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " all young ladies accomplished ! my dear charles , what do you mean <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , all of them , i think . they all paint tables , cover skreens and net <END>
<BEGIN> purses . i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i <END>
<BEGIN> never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being <END>
<BEGIN> informed that she was very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy , " has <END>
<BEGIN> too much truth . the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no <END>
<BEGIN> otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen . but i am very <END>
<BEGIN> far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . i <END>
<BEGIN> cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance , that are really <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " nor i , i am sure said miss bingley . <END>
<BEGIN> " then observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your <END>
<BEGIN> idea of an accomplished <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! certainly cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really <END>
<BEGIN> esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met <END>
<BEGIN> with . a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , <END>
<BEGIN> dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all <END>
<BEGIN> this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of <END>
<BEGIN> walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word <END>
<BEGIN> will be but half <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " all this she must possess added darcy , " and to all this she must yet <END>
<BEGIN> add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by <END>
<BEGIN> extensive <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am no longer surprised at your knowing _ only _ six accomplished women . <END>
<BEGIN> i rather wonder now at your knowing <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all <END>
<BEGIN> this <END>
<BEGIN> i _ never saw such a woman . _ i _ never saw such capacity , and taste , and <END>
<BEGIN> application , and elegance , as you describe , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her <END>
<BEGIN> implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who <END>
<BEGIN> answered this description , when mr . hurst called them to order , with <END>
<BEGIN> bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . as all <END>
<BEGIN> conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the <END>
<BEGIN> room . <END>
<BEGIN> " eliza bennet said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is <END>
<BEGIN> one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other <END>
<BEGIN> sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it <END>
<BEGIN> succeeds . but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " undoubtedly replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , <END>
<BEGIN> " there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend <END>
<BEGIN> to employ for captivation . whatever bears affinity to cunning is <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to <END>
<BEGIN> continue the subject . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and <END>
<BEGIN> that she could not leave her . bingley urged mr . jones ' s being sent for <END>
<BEGIN> immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could <END>
<BEGIN> be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <END>
<BEGIN> eminent physicians . this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so <END>
<BEGIN> unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled <END>
<BEGIN> that mr . jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet <END>
<BEGIN> were not decidedly better . bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters <END>
<BEGIN> declared that they were miserable . they solaced their wretchedness , <END>
<BEGIN> however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to <END>
<BEGIN> his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every <END>
<BEGIN> possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter ix . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the <END>
<BEGIN> morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the <END>
<BEGIN> enquiries which she very early received from mr . bingley by a housemaid , <END>
<BEGIN> and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his <END>
<BEGIN> sisters . in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a <END>
<BEGIN> note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her <END>
<BEGIN> own judgment of her situation . the note was immediately dispatched , and <END>
<BEGIN> its contents as quickly complied with . mrs . bennet , accompanied by her <END>
<BEGIN> two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast . <END>
<BEGIN> had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs . bennet would have been <END>
<BEGIN> very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was <END>
<BEGIN> not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her <END>
<BEGIN> restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield . she <END>
<BEGIN> would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried <END>
<BEGIN> home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think <END>
<BEGIN> it at all advisable . after sitting a little while with jane , on miss <END>
<BEGIN> bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all <END>
<BEGIN> attended her into the breakfast parlour . bingley met them with hopes <END>
<BEGIN> that mrs . bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected . <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed i have , sir was her answer . " she is a great deal too ill to be <END>
<BEGIN> moved . mr . jones says we must not think of moving her . we must trespass <END>
<BEGIN> a little longer on your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " removed cried bingley . " it must not be thought of . my sister , i am <END>
<BEGIN> sure , will not hear of her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you may depend upon it , madam said miss bingley , with cold civility , <END>
<BEGIN> " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she <END>
<BEGIN> remains with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am sure she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not <END>
<BEGIN> know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a <END>
<BEGIN> vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is <END>

<BEGIN> _ her you have a sweet room here , mr . bingley , and a charming prospect <END>
<BEGIN> over that gravel walk . i do not know a place in the country that is <END>
<BEGIN> equal to netherfield . you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i <END>
<BEGIN> hope , though you have but a short <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he ; " and therefore if i <END>
<BEGIN> should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five <END>
<BEGIN> minutes . at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> " you begin to comprehend me , do you cried he , turning towards her . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! yes i understand you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen <END>
<BEGIN> through i am afraid is <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is as it happens . it does not necessarily follow that a deep , <END>
<BEGIN> intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " lizzy cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in <END>
<BEGIN> the wild manner that you are suffered to do at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i did not know before continued bingley immediately , " that you were a <END>

<BEGIN> " yes ; but intricate characters are the _ most _ amusing . they have at <END>
<BEGIN> least that <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " the country said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for <END>
<BEGIN> such a study . in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined <END>
<BEGIN> and unvarying <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be <END>
<BEGIN> observed in them for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , indeed cried mrs . bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a <END>
<BEGIN> country neighbourhood . " i assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ <END>
<BEGIN> going on in the country as in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , <END>
<BEGIN> turned silently away . mrs . bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <END>
<BEGIN> victory over him , continued her triumph . <END>
<BEGIN> " i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for <END>
<BEGIN> my part , except the shops and public places . the country is a vast deal <END>
<BEGIN> pleasanter , is not it , mr . bingley <END>
<BEGIN> " when i am in the country he replied , " i never wish to leave it ; and <END>
<BEGIN> when i am in town it is pretty much the same . they have each their <END>
<BEGIN> advantages , and i can be equally happy in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " aye that is because you have the right disposition . but that <END>
<BEGIN> gentleman looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing <END>
<BEGIN> at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed , mama , you are mistaken said elizabeth , blushing for her <END>
<BEGIN> mother . " you quite mistook mr . darcy . he only meant that there were not <END>
<BEGIN> such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which <END>
<BEGIN> you must acknowledge to be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with <END>
<BEGIN> many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhoods larger . i know we dine with four and twenty <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his <END>
<BEGIN> countenance . his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy with a very expressive smile . elizabeth , for the sake of <END>
<BEGIN> saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _ her _ coming away . <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , she called yesterday with her father . what an agreeable man sir <END>
<BEGIN> william is , mr . bingley is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so <END>
<BEGIN> genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy <END>
<BEGIN> themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " did charlotte dine with you <END>
<BEGIN> " no , she would go home . i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies . for <END>
<BEGIN> my part , mr . bingley , _ i _ always keep servants that can do their own <END>
<BEGIN> work ; _ my _ daughters are brought up differently . but every body is to <END>
<BEGIN> judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i <END>
<BEGIN> assure you . it is a pity they are not handsome ! not that _ i _ think <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte so _ very _ plain but then she is our particular <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! dear , yes but you must own she is very plain . lady lucas herself <END>
<BEGIN> has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty . i do not like to boast <END>
<BEGIN> of my own child , but to be sure , jane one does not often see any body <END>
<BEGIN> better looking . it is what every body says . i do not trust my own <END>
<BEGIN> partiality . when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my <END>
<BEGIN> brother gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my <END>
<BEGIN> sister in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . <END>
<BEGIN> but however he did not . perhaps he thought her too young . however , he <END>
<BEGIN> wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently . " there has <END>
<BEGIN> been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way . i wonder who first <END>
<BEGIN> discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love <END>
<BEGIN> " i have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love said darcy . <END>
<BEGIN> " of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . every thing nourishes what is <END>
<BEGIN> strong already . but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i <END>
<BEGIN> am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . she longed to <END>
<BEGIN> speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet began repeating her thanks to mr . bingley for his kindness to <END>
<BEGIN> jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy . mr . bingley was <END>
<BEGIN> unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be <END>
<BEGIN> civil also , and say what the occasion required . she performed her part <END>
<BEGIN> indeed without much graciousness , but mrs . bennet was satisfied , and <END>
<BEGIN> soon afterwards ordered her carriage . upon this signal , the youngest of <END>
<BEGIN> her daughters put herself forward . the two girls had been whispering to <END>
<BEGIN> each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the <END>
<BEGIN> youngest should tax mr . bingley with having promised on his first coming <END>
<BEGIN> into the country to give a ball at netherfield . <END>
<BEGIN> lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion <END>
<BEGIN> and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose <END>
<BEGIN> affection had brought her into public at an early age . she had high <END>
<BEGIN> animal spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the <END>
<BEGIN> attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own <END>
<BEGIN> easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . she was very <END>
<BEGIN> equal therefore to address mr . bingley on the subject of the ball , and <END>
<BEGIN> abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most <END>
<BEGIN> shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . his answer to this <END>
<BEGIN> sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s ear . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when <END>
<BEGIN> your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of <END>
<BEGIN> the ball . but you would not wish to be dancing while she is <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> lydia declared herself satisfied . " oh ! yes it would be much better to <END>
<BEGIN> wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter <END>
<BEGIN> would be at meryton again . and when you have given _ your _ ball she <END>
<BEGIN> added , " i shall insist on their giving one also . i shall tell colonel <END>
<BEGIN> forster it will be quite a shame if he does <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned <END>
<BEGIN> instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the <END>
<BEGIN> remarks of the two ladies and mr . darcy ; the latter of whom , however , <END>
<BEGIN> could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ her in spite of <END>
<BEGIN> all miss bingley ' s witticisms on _ fine eyes <END>
<BEGIN> chapter x . <END>
<BEGIN> the day passed much as the day before had done . mrs . hurst and miss <END>
<BEGIN> bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who <END>
<BEGIN> continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined <END>
<BEGIN> their party in the drawing room . the loo table , however , did not appear . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching <END>
<BEGIN> the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by <END>
<BEGIN> messages to his sister . mr . hurst and mr . bingley were at piquet , and <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . hurst was observing their game . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in <END>
<BEGIN> attending to what passed between darcy and his companion . the perpetual <END>
<BEGIN> commendations of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness <END>
<BEGIN> of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern <END>
<BEGIN> with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was <END>
<BEGIN> exactly in unison with her opinion of each . <END>
<BEGIN> " how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter <END>
<BEGIN> he made no answer . <END>
<BEGIN> " you write uncommonly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are mistaken . i write rather <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the <END>
<BEGIN> year ! letters of business too ! how odious i should think them <END>
<BEGIN> " it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " pray tell your sister that i long to see <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> " thank you but i always mend my <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> he was silent . <END>
<BEGIN> " tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , <END>
<BEGIN> and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful <END>

<BEGIN> present i have not room to do them <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! it is of no consequence . i shall see her in january . but do you <END>
<BEGIN> always write such charming long letters to her , mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> " they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me <END>
<BEGIN> to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with <END>
<BEGIN> ease , cannot write <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline cried her <END>
<BEGIN> brother because he does _ not _ write with ease . he studies too much for <END>
<BEGIN> words of four <URL> not you , darcy <END>
<BEGIN> " my style of writing is very different from <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh cried miss bingley , " charles writes in the most careless way <END>
<BEGIN> imaginable . he leaves out half his words , and blots the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which <END>
<BEGIN> means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " your humility , mr . bingley said elizabeth , " must disarm <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " nothing is more deceitful said darcy , " than the appearance of <END>
<BEGIN> humility . it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an <END>
<BEGIN> indirect <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and which of the two do you call _ my _ little recent piece of modesty <END>
<BEGIN> " the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in <END>
<BEGIN> writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of <END>
<BEGIN> thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think <END>
<BEGIN> at least highly interesting . the power of doing any thing with <END>
<BEGIN> quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any <END>
<BEGIN> attention to the imperfection of the performance . when you told mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of <END>
<BEGIN> panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very <END>
<BEGIN> laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <END>
<BEGIN> undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else <END>
<BEGIN> " nay cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the <END>
<BEGIN> foolish things that were said in the morning . and yet , upon my honour , i <END>
<BEGIN> believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this <END>
<BEGIN> moment . at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless <END>
<BEGIN> precipitance merely to shew off before the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you <END>
<BEGIN> would be gone with such celerity . your conduct would be quite as <END>
<BEGIN> dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were <END>
<BEGIN> mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ' bingley , you had better stay <END>
<BEGIN> till next week you would probably do it , you would probably not <END>
<BEGIN> go and , at another word , might stay a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you have only proved by this cried elizabeth , " that mr . bingley did <END>
<BEGIN> not do justice to his own disposition . you have shewn him off now much <END>
<BEGIN> more than he did <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am exceedingly gratified said bingley , " by your converting what my <END>
<BEGIN> friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . but i am <END>
<BEGIN> afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means <END>
<BEGIN> intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a <END>
<BEGIN> circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " would mr . darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention <END>
<BEGIN> as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it <END>
<BEGIN> " upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but <END>
<BEGIN> which i have never acknowledged . allowing the case , however , to stand <END>
<BEGIN> according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that <END>
<BEGIN> the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the <END>
<BEGIN> delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one <END>
<BEGIN> argument in favour of its <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " to yield readily easily to the _ persuasion _ of a friend is no merit <END>
<BEGIN> with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you appear to me , mr . darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of <END>
<BEGIN> friendship and affection . a regard for the requester would often make <END>
<BEGIN> one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason <END>
<BEGIN> one into it . i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have <END>
<BEGIN> supposed about mr . bingley . we may as well wait , perhaps , till the <END>
<BEGIN> circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour <END>
<BEGIN> thereupon . but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , <END>
<BEGIN> where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no <END>
<BEGIN> very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying <END>
<BEGIN> with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it <END>
<BEGIN> " will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange <END>
<BEGIN> with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to <END>
<BEGIN> appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting <END>
<BEGIN> between the parties <END>
<BEGIN> " by all means cried bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not <END>
<BEGIN> forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more <END>
<BEGIN> weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of . i assure <END>
<BEGIN> you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with <END>
<BEGIN> myself , i should not pay him half so much deference . i declare i do not <END>
<BEGIN> know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in <END>
<BEGIN> particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening <END>
<BEGIN> when he has nothing to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was <END>
<BEGIN> rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . miss bingley warmly <END>
<BEGIN> resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her <END>
<BEGIN> brother for talking such nonsense . <END>
<BEGIN> " i see your design , bingley said his <URL> dislike an <END>
<BEGIN> argument , and want to silence <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " perhaps i do . arguments are too much like disputes . if you and miss <END>
<BEGIN> bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very <END>
<BEGIN> thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " what you ask said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy had much better finish his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . <END>
<BEGIN> when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> for the indulgence of some music . miss bingley moved with alacrity to <END>
<BEGIN> the piano forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead <END>
<BEGIN> the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she <END>
<BEGIN> seated herself . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books <END>
<BEGIN> that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr . darcy ' s eyes were fixed <END>
<BEGIN> on her . she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of <END>
<BEGIN> admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because <END>
<BEGIN> he disliked her , was still more strange . she could only imagine however <END>
<BEGIN> at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about <END>
<BEGIN> her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than <END>
<BEGIN> in any other person present . the supposition did not pain her . she liked <END>
<BEGIN> him too little to care for his approbation . <END>
<BEGIN> after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a <END>
<BEGIN> lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr . darcy , drawing near <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , said to her <END>
<BEGIN> " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an <END>
<BEGIN> opportunity of dancing a reel <END>
<BEGIN> she smiled , but made no answer . he repeated the question , with some <END>
<BEGIN> surprise at her silence . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately <END>
<BEGIN> determine what to say in reply . you wanted me , i know , to say ' yes <END>
<BEGIN> that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always <END>
<BEGIN> delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of <END>
<BEGIN> their premeditated contempt . i have therefore made up my mind to tell <END>
<BEGIN> you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if <END>
<BEGIN> you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed i do not <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his <END>
<BEGIN> gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her <END>
<BEGIN> manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had <END>
<BEGIN> never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . he really <END>
<BEGIN> believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he <END>
<BEGIN> should be in some danger . <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great <END>
<BEGIN> anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some <END>
<BEGIN> assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of <END>
<BEGIN> their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . <END>
<BEGIN> " i hope said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the <END>
<BEGIN> next day , " you will give your mother in - law a few hints , when this <END>
<BEGIN> desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; <END>
<BEGIN> and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after <END>
<BEGIN> the <URL> if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to <END>
<BEGIN> check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , <END>
<BEGIN> which your lady <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! <URL> let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be <END>
<BEGIN> placed in the gallery at pemberley . put them next to your great uncle <END>
<BEGIN> the judge . they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different <END>
<BEGIN> lines . as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it <END>
<BEGIN> taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes <END>
<BEGIN> " it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their <END>
<BEGIN> colour and shape , and the eye lashes , so remarkably fine , might be <END>

<BEGIN> at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs . hurst and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth herself . <END>
<BEGIN> " i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley , in some <END>
<BEGIN> confusion , lest they had been overheard . <END>
<BEGIN> " you used us abominably ill answered mrs . hurst , " in running away <END>
<BEGIN> without telling us that you were coming <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> then taking the disengaged arm of mr . darcy , she left elizabeth to walk <END>
<BEGIN> by herself . the path just admitted three . mr . darcy felt their rudeness <END>
<BEGIN> and immediately said <END>
<BEGIN> " this walk is not wide enough for our party . we had better go into the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , <END>
<BEGIN> laughingly answered , <END>
<BEGIN> " no , no ; stay where you <URL> are charmingly group ' d , and appear to <END>
<BEGIN> uncommon advantage . the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a <END>
<BEGIN> fourth . good <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of <END>
<BEGIN> being at home again in a day or two . jane was already so much recovered <END>
<BEGIN> as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xi . <END>
<BEGIN> when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , <END>
<BEGIN> and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the <END>
<BEGIN> drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many <END>
<BEGIN> professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable <END>
<BEGIN> as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . <END>
<BEGIN> their powers of conversation were considerable . they could describe an <END>
<BEGIN> entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh <END>
<BEGIN> at their acquaintance with spirit . <END>
<BEGIN> but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object . <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had <END>
<BEGIN> something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . he addressed <END>
<BEGIN> himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr . hurst <END>
<BEGIN> also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad but diffuseness <END>
<BEGIN> and warmth remained for bingley ' s salutation . he was full of joy and <END>
<BEGIN> attention . the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she <END>
<BEGIN> should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to <END>
<BEGIN> the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the <END>
<BEGIN> door . he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great <END>
<BEGIN> delight . <END>
<BEGIN> when tea was over , mr . hurst reminded his sister in - law of the <END>
<BEGIN> card table but in vain . she had obtained private intelligence that mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr . hurst soon found even his open <END>
<BEGIN> petition rejected . she assured him that no one intended to play , and the <END>
<BEGIN> silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . mr . <END>
<BEGIN> hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the <END>
<BEGIN> sophas and go to sleep . darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; <END>
<BEGIN> and mrs . hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and <END>
<BEGIN> rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss <END>
<BEGIN> bennet . <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ' s progress through _ his _ book , as in reading her own ; and she was <END>
<BEGIN> perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . she <END>
<BEGIN> could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her <END>
<BEGIN> question , and read on . at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be <END>
<BEGIN> amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the <END>
<BEGIN> second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it <END>
<BEGIN> is to spend an evening in this way ! i declare after all there is no <END>
<BEGIN> enjoyment like reading ! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a <END>
<BEGIN> book when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not <END>
<BEGIN> an excellent <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> no one made any reply . she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and <END>
<BEGIN> cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing <END>
<BEGIN> her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly <END>
<BEGIN> towards him and said , <END>
<BEGIN> " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at <END>
<BEGIN> netherfield i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult <END>

<BEGIN> miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about <END>
<BEGIN> the room . her figure was elegant , and she walked well but darcy , at <END>
<BEGIN> whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . in the desperation <END>
<BEGIN> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , said , <END>
<BEGIN> " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a <END>
<BEGIN> turn about the <URL> assure you it is very refreshing after sitting <END>
<BEGIN> so long in one <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . miss bingley <END>
<BEGIN> succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr . darcy looked <END>
<BEGIN> up . he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . he was <END>
<BEGIN> directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , <END>
<BEGIN> that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and <END>
<BEGIN> down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them <END>
<BEGIN> would interfere . " what could he mean ? she was dying to know what could <END>
<BEGIN> be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand <END>
<BEGIN> him ? <END>
<BEGIN> " not at all was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe <END>
<BEGIN> on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing <END>
<BEGIN> about <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr . darcy in any <END>
<BEGIN> thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two <END>
<BEGIN> motives . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he , as soon <END>
<BEGIN> as she allowed him to speak . " you either chuse this method of passing <END>

<BEGIN> it . he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xii . <END>
<BEGIN> in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the <END>
<BEGIN> next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for <END>
<BEGIN> them in the course of the day . but mrs . bennet , who had calculated on <END>
<BEGIN> her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which <END>
<BEGIN> would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive <END>
<BEGIN> them with pleasure before . her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at <END>
<BEGIN> least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage <END>
<BEGIN> before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr . bingley <END>
<BEGIN> and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively <END>
<BEGIN> resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the <END>
<BEGIN> contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , <END>
<BEGIN> she urged jane to borrow mr . bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at <END>
<BEGIN> length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . <END>
<BEGIN> the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was <END>
<BEGIN> said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on <END>
<BEGIN> jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . miss bingley was <END>
<BEGIN> then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike <END>
<BEGIN> of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . <END>
<BEGIN> the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so <END>
<BEGIN> soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be <END>
<BEGIN> safe for her that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where <END>
<BEGIN> she felt herself to be right . <END>
<BEGIN> to mr . darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at <END>
<BEGIN> netherfield long enough . she attracted him more than he liked and miss <END>
<BEGIN> bingley was uncivil to _ her and more teazing than usual to himself . <END>
<BEGIN> he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration <END>
<BEGIN> should _ now _ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of <END>
<BEGIN> influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been <END>
<BEGIN> suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight <END>
<BEGIN> in confirming or crushing it . steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke <END>
<BEGIN> ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at <END>
<BEGIN> one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most <END>
<BEGIN> conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her . <END>
<BEGIN> on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost <END>
<BEGIN> all , took place . miss bingley ' s civility to elizabeth increased at last <END>
<BEGIN> very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , <END>
<BEGIN> after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to <END>
<BEGIN> see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most <END>
<BEGIN> tenderly , she even shook hands with the <URL> took leave of <END>
<BEGIN> the whole party in the liveliest spirits . <END>
<BEGIN> they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . mrs . bennet <END>
<BEGIN> wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much <END>
<BEGIN> trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold <URL> their <END>
<BEGIN> father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really <END>
<BEGIN> glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . the <END>
<BEGIN> evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its <END>
<BEGIN> animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human <END>
<BEGIN> nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations <END>
<BEGIN> of thread bare morality to listen to . catherine and lydia had <END>
<BEGIN> information for them of a different sort . much had been done , and much <END>
<BEGIN> had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of <END>
<BEGIN> the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been <END>
<BEGIN> flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going <END>
<BEGIN> to be married . <END>

<BEGIN> this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being <END>
<BEGIN> eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . <END>
<BEGIN> after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained . <END>
<BEGIN> " about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i <END>

<BEGIN> jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . <END>
<BEGIN> they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail <END>
<BEGIN> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of <END>
<BEGIN> five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . <END>
<BEGIN> " it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr . bennet , " and <END>
<BEGIN> nothing can clear mr . collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn . <END>
<BEGIN> but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little <END>
<BEGIN> softened by his manner of expressing <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing <END>
<BEGIN> lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good <END>
<BEGIN> terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> mrs . <URL> mind however is now made up on <END>
<BEGIN> the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been <END>
<BEGIN> so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right <END>
<BEGIN> honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , <END>
<BEGIN> whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable <END>
<BEGIN> rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <END>
<BEGIN> demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be <END>
<BEGIN> ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are <END>
<BEGIN> instituted by the church of england . as a clergyman , moreover , i <END>
<BEGIN> feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in <END>
<BEGIN> all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds <END>
<BEGIN> i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly <END>
<BEGIN> commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the <END>
<BEGIN> entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , <END>

<BEGIN> to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any <END>
<BEGIN> degree interesting . it was next to impossible that their cousin should <END>
<BEGIN> come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had <END>
<BEGIN> received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . as for <END>
<BEGIN> their mother , mr . collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , <END>
<BEGIN> and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which <END>
<BEGIN> astonished her husband and daughters . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great <END>
<BEGIN> politeness by the whole family . mr . bennet indeed said little ; but the <END>
<BEGIN> ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr . collins seemed neither in need <END>
<BEGIN> of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . he was a tall , <END>
<BEGIN> heavy looking young man of five and twenty . his air was grave and <END>
<BEGIN> stately , and his manners were very formal . he had not been long seated <END>
<BEGIN> before he complimented mrs . bennet on having so fine a family of <END>
<BEGIN> daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this <END>
<BEGIN> instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did <END>
<BEGIN> not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . <END>
<BEGIN> this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , <END>
<BEGIN> " you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may <END>
<BEGIN> prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . things are settled so <END>

<BEGIN> he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each <END>
<BEGIN> other . they were not the only objects of mr . collins ' s admiration . the <END>
<BEGIN> hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; <END>
<BEGIN> and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs . bennet ' s <END>
<BEGIN> heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his <END>
<BEGIN> own future property . the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and <END>
<BEGIN> he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <END>
<BEGIN> cookery was owing . but here he was set right by mrs . bennet , who assured <END>
<BEGIN> him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good <END>
<BEGIN> cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen . he begged <END>
<BEGIN> pardon for having displeased her . in a softened tone she declared <END>
<BEGIN> herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a <END>
<BEGIN> quarter of an hour . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xiv . <END>
<BEGIN> during dinner , mr . bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants <END>
<BEGIN> were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his <END>
<BEGIN> guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <END>
<BEGIN> shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine de bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his <END>
<BEGIN> comfort , appeared very remarkable . mr . bennet could not have chosen <END>
<BEGIN> better . mr . collins was eloquent in her praise . the subject elevated him <END>
<BEGIN> to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect <END>
<BEGIN> he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a <END>
<BEGIN> person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself <END>
<BEGIN> experienced from lady catherine . she had been graciously pleased to <END>
<BEGIN> approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of <END>
<BEGIN> preaching before her . she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , <END>
<BEGIN> and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of <END>
<BEGIN> quadrille in the evening . lady catherine was reckoned proud by many <END>
<BEGIN> people he knew , but _ he _ had never seen any thing but affability in her . <END>
<BEGIN> she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she <END>
<BEGIN> made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or <END>
<BEGIN> two , to visit his relations . she had even condescended to advise him to <END>
<BEGIN> marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had <END>
<BEGIN> once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed <END>
<BEGIN> to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs . <END>
<BEGIN> " that is all very proper and civil , i am sure said mrs . bennet , " and i <END>
<BEGIN> dare say she is a very agreeable woman . it is a pity that great ladies <END>
<BEGIN> in general are not more like her . does she live near you , sir <END>
<BEGIN> " the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane <END>
<BEGIN> from rosings park , her ladyship ' s <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> many girls . and what sort of young lady is she ? is she handsome <END>

<BEGIN> that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the <END>
<BEGIN> handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks <END>
<BEGIN> the young woman of distinguished birth . she is unfortunately of a sickly <END>
<BEGIN> constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many <END>
<BEGIN> accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am <END>
<BEGIN> informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still <END>
<BEGIN> resides with them . but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends <END>
<BEGIN> to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " has she been presented ? i do not remember her name among the ladies at <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; <END>
<BEGIN> and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived <END>
<BEGIN> the british court of its brightest ornament . her ladyship seemed pleased <END>
<BEGIN> with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to <END>
<BEGIN> offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to <END>
<BEGIN> ladies . i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her <END>
<BEGIN> charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most <END>
<BEGIN> elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and <END>
<BEGIN> it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you judge very properly said mr . bennet , " and it is happy for you <END>
<BEGIN> that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . may i ask <END>
<BEGIN> whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the <END>
<BEGIN> moment , or are the result of previous study <END>
<BEGIN> " they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i <END>
<BEGIN> sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant <END>
<BEGIN> compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to <END>
<BEGIN> give them as unstudied an air as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet ' s expectations were fully answered . his cousin was as absurd <END>
<BEGIN> as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , <END>
<BEGIN> maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , <END>
<BEGIN> and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in <END>
<BEGIN> his pleasure . <END>
<BEGIN> by tea time however the dose had been enough , and mr . bennet was glad to <END>
<BEGIN> take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad <END>
<BEGIN> to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . mr . collins readily assented , <END>
<BEGIN> and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced <END>
<BEGIN> it to be from a circulating library he started back , and begging <END>
<BEGIN> pardon , protested that he never read <URL> stared at him , and <END>
<BEGIN> lydia <URL> books were produced , and after some deliberation <END>
<BEGIN> he chose fordyce ' s sermons . lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and <END>
<BEGIN> before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she <END>
<BEGIN> interrupted him with , <END>
<BEGIN> " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , <END>
<BEGIN> and if he does , colonel forster will hire him . my aunt told me so <END>
<BEGIN> herself on saturday . i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more <END>
<BEGIN> about it , and to ask when mr . denny comes back from <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , <END>
<BEGIN> " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books <END>
<BEGIN> of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . it amazes <END>
<BEGIN> me , i confess for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to <END>
<BEGIN> them as instruction . but i will no longer importune my young <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> then turning to mr . bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at <END>
<BEGIN> backgammon . mr . bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted <END>
<BEGIN> very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia ' s <END>
<BEGIN> interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would <END>
<BEGIN> resume his book ; but mr . collins , after assuring them that he bore his <END>
<BEGIN> young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any <END>
<BEGIN> affront , seated himself at another table with mr . bennet , and prepared <END>
<BEGIN> for backgammon . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xv . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had <END>
<BEGIN> been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of <END>
<BEGIN> his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and <END>
<BEGIN> miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he <END>
<BEGIN> had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance . the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had <END>
<BEGIN> given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good <END>
<BEGIN> deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in <END>
<BEGIN> retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected <END>
<BEGIN> prosperity . a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de <END>
<BEGIN> bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he <END>
<BEGIN> felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , <END>
<BEGIN> mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a <END>
<BEGIN> clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of <END>
<BEGIN> pride and obsequiousness , self importance and humility . <END>
<BEGIN> having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to <END>
<BEGIN> marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had <END>
<BEGIN> a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found <END>
<BEGIN> them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . <END>
<BEGIN> this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s <END>
<BEGIN> estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and <END>
<BEGIN> suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own <END>
<BEGIN> part . <END>
<BEGIN> his plan did not vary on seeing <URL> bennet ' s lovely face <END>
<BEGIN> confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what <END>
<BEGIN> was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _ she _ was his settled <END>
<BEGIN> choice . the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter <END>
<BEGIN> of an hour ' s tête à - tête with mrs . bennet before breakfast , a <END>
<BEGIN> conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally <END>
<BEGIN> to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general <END>
<BEGIN> encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed <URL> to <END>
<BEGIN> her _ younger _ daughters she could not take upon her to say she could <END>
<BEGIN> not positively answer but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession her <END>
<BEGIN> _ eldest _ daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her <END>
<BEGIN> to hint , was likely to be very soon <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon <END>
<BEGIN> done done while mrs . bennet was stirring the fire . elizabeth , equally <END>
<BEGIN> next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have <END>
<BEGIN> two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of <END>
<BEGIN> the day before , was now high in her good graces . <END>
<BEGIN> lydia ' s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister <END>
<BEGIN> except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr . collins was to attend them , <END>
<BEGIN> at the request of mr . bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , <END>
<BEGIN> and have his library to himself ; for thither mr . collins had followed <END>
<BEGIN> him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with <END>
<BEGIN> one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford . such <END>
<BEGIN> doings discomposed mr . bennet exceedingly . in his library he had been <END>
<BEGIN> always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the <END>
<BEGIN> house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , <END>
<BEGIN> was most prompt in inviting mr . collins to join his daughters in their <END>
<BEGIN> walk ; and mr . collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker <END>
<BEGIN> than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and <END>
<BEGIN> go . <END>
<BEGIN> in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his <END>
<BEGIN> cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton . the attention of <END>
<BEGIN> the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _ him their eyes <END>
<BEGIN> were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , <END>
<BEGIN> and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin <END>
<BEGIN> in a shop window , could recal them . <END>
<BEGIN> but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom <END>
<BEGIN> they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking <END>
<BEGIN> with an officer on the other side of the way . the officer was the very <END>
<BEGIN> mr . denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , <END>
<BEGIN> and he bowed as they passed . all were struck with the stranger ' s air , <END>
<BEGIN> all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if <END>
<BEGIN> possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of <END>
<BEGIN> wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained <END>
<BEGIN> the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same <END>
<BEGIN> spot . mr . denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to <END>
<BEGIN> introduce his friend , mr . wickham , who had returned with him the day <END>
<BEGIN> before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in <END>
<BEGIN> their corps . this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted <END>
<BEGIN> only regimentals to make him completely charming . his appearance was <END>
<BEGIN> greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine <END>
<BEGIN> countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . the introduction <END>
<BEGIN> was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a <END>
<BEGIN> readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the <END>
<BEGIN> whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , <END>
<BEGIN> when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were <END>
<BEGIN> seen riding down the street . on distinguishing the ladies of the group , <END>
<BEGIN> the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual <END>
<BEGIN> civilities . bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the <END>
<BEGIN> principal object . he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on <END>
<BEGIN> purpose to inquire after her . mr . darcy corroborated it with a bow , and <END>
<BEGIN> was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they <END>
<BEGIN> were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , <END>
<BEGIN> was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . both changed colour , <END>
<BEGIN> one looked white , the other red . mr . wickham , after a few moments , <END>
<BEGIN> touched his hat a salutation which mr . darcy just deigned to return . <END>
<BEGIN> what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine ; it was <END>
<BEGIN> impossible not to long to know . <END>
<BEGIN> in another minute mr . bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what <END>
<BEGIN> passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . denny and mr . wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of <END>
<BEGIN> mr . philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s <END>
<BEGIN> pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the <END>
<BEGIN> invitation . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from <END>
<BEGIN> their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly <END>
<BEGIN> expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own <END>
<BEGIN> carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if <END>
<BEGIN> she had not happened to see mr . jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had <END>
<BEGIN> told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed <END>
<BEGIN> towards mr . collins by jane ' s introduction of him . she received him with <END>
<BEGIN> her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , <END>
<BEGIN> apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with <END>
<BEGIN> her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be <END>
<BEGIN> justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to <END>
<BEGIN> her notice . mrs . philips was quite awed by such an excess of good <END>
<BEGIN> breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to <END>
<BEGIN> by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she <END>
<BEGIN> could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr . denny had <END>
<BEGIN> brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s <END>
<BEGIN> commission in the shire . she had been watching him the last hour , <END>
<BEGIN> she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr . wickham <END>
<BEGIN> appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , <END>
<BEGIN> but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the <END>
<BEGIN> officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , <END>
<BEGIN> disagreeable <URL> some of them were to dine with the philipses the <END>
<BEGIN> next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr . <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn <END>
<BEGIN> would come in the evening . this was agreed to , and mrs . philips <END>
<BEGIN> protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery <END>
<BEGIN> tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . the prospect of such <END>
<BEGIN> delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured <END>
<BEGIN> with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless . <END>
<BEGIN> as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass <END>
<BEGIN> between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or <END>
<BEGIN> both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such <END>
<BEGIN> behaviour than her sister . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins on his return highly gratified mrs . bennet by admiring mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> philips ' s manners and politeness . he protested that except lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for <END>
<BEGIN> she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <END>
<BEGIN> pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although <END>
<BEGIN> utterly unknown to her before . something he supposed might be attributed <END>
<BEGIN> to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much <END>
<BEGIN> attention in the whole course of his life . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xvi . <END>
<BEGIN> as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their <END>
<BEGIN> aunt , and all mr . collins ' s scruples of leaving mr . and mrs . bennet for <END>
<BEGIN> a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach <END>
<BEGIN> conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the <END>
<BEGIN> girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , <END>
<BEGIN> that mr . wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in <END>
<BEGIN> the house . <END>
<BEGIN> when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much <END>
<BEGIN> struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he <END>
<BEGIN> might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour <END>
<BEGIN> at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much <END>
<BEGIN> gratification ; but when mrs . philips understood from him what rosings <END>
<BEGIN> was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the <END>
<BEGIN> description of only one of lady catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found <END>
<BEGIN> that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all <END>
<BEGIN> the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison <END>
<BEGIN> with the housekeeper ' s room . <END>
<BEGIN> in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , <END>
<BEGIN> with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the <END>
<BEGIN> improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the <END>
<BEGIN> gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs . philips a very attentive <END>
<BEGIN> listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she <END>
<BEGIN> heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as <END>
<BEGIN> soon as she could . to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , <END>
<BEGIN> and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine <END>
<BEGIN> their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece , the <END>
<BEGIN> interval of waiting appeared very long . it was over at last however . the <END>
<BEGIN> gentlemen did approach ; and when mr . wickham walked into the room , <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking <END>
<BEGIN> of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . the <END>
<BEGIN> officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , <END>
<BEGIN> gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and <END>
<BEGIN> walk , as _ they _ were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips , <END>
<BEGIN> breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was <END>
<BEGIN> turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated <END>
<BEGIN> himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into <END>
<BEGIN> conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the <END>
<BEGIN> probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , <END>
<BEGIN> dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the <END>
<BEGIN> skill of the speaker . <END>
<BEGIN> with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr . wickham and the <END>
<BEGIN> officers , mr . collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the <END>
<BEGIN> young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a <END>
<BEGIN> kind listener in mrs . philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most <END>
<BEGIN> abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . <END>
<BEGIN> when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her <END>
<BEGIN> in return , by sitting down to whist . <END>
<BEGIN> " i know little of the game , at present said he , " but i shall be glad <END>
<BEGIN> to improve myself , for in my situation of life mrs . philips was <END>
<BEGIN> very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he <END>
<BEGIN> received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia . at first there <END>
<BEGIN> seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most <END>
<BEGIN> determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , <END>
<BEGIN> she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets <END>
<BEGIN> and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in <END>
<BEGIN> particular . allowing for the common demands of the game , mr . wickham was <END>
<BEGIN> therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to <END>
<BEGIN> hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to <END>
<BEGIN> be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr . darcy . she dared not <END>
<BEGIN> even mention that gentleman . her curiosity however was unexpectedly <END>
<BEGIN> relieved . mr . wickham began the subject himself . he inquired how far <END>
<BEGIN> netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in <END>
<BEGIN> an hesitating manner how long mr . darcy had been staying there . <END>
<BEGIN> " about a month said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject <END>
<BEGIN> drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one . a clear ten <END>
<BEGIN> thousand per annum . you could not have met with a person more capable of <END>
<BEGIN> giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been <END>
<BEGIN> connected with his family in a particular manner from my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could not but look surprised . <END>
<BEGIN> " you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after <END>
<BEGIN> seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> you much acquainted with mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> " as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent <END>
<BEGIN> four days in the same house with him , and i think him very <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i have no right to give _ my _ opinion said wickham , " as to his being <END>
<BEGIN> agreeable or otherwise . i am not qualified to form one . i have known him <END>
<BEGIN> too long and too well to be a fair judge . it is impossible for _ me _ to <END>
<BEGIN> be impartial . but i believe your opinion of him would in general <END>
<BEGIN> astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly <END>
<BEGIN> anywhere <URL> you are in your own <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " upon my word i say no more _ here _ than i might say in any house in the <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhood , except netherfield . he is not at all liked in <END>
<BEGIN> hertfordshire . every body is disgusted with his pride . you will not find <END>
<BEGIN> him more favourably spoken of by any <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham , after a short <END>
<BEGIN> interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond <END>
<BEGIN> their deserts ; but with _ him _ i believe it does not often happen . the <END>
<BEGIN> world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his <END>
<BEGIN> high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an <END>
<BEGIN> ill tempered <URL> wickham only shook his head . <END>
<BEGIN> " i wonder said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is <END>
<BEGIN> likely to be in this country much <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not at all know ; but i _ heard _ nothing of his going away when i <END>
<BEGIN> was at netherfield . i hope your plans in favour of the shire will <END>
<BEGIN> not be affected by his being in the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! no it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by mr . darcy . if _ he _ <END>
<BEGIN> wishes to avoid seeing _ me he must go . we are not on friendly terms , <END>
<BEGIN> and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for <END>
<BEGIN> avoiding _ him _ but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of <END>
<BEGIN> very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . <END>
<BEGIN> his father , miss bennet , the late mr . darcy , was one of the best men <END>
<BEGIN> that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be <END>
<BEGIN> in company with this mr . darcy without being grieved to the soul by a <END>
<BEGIN> thousand tender recollections . his behaviour to myself has been <END>
<BEGIN> scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every <END>
<BEGIN> thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory <END>
<BEGIN> of his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with <END>
<BEGIN> all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he <END>
<BEGIN> had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but <END>
<BEGIN> very intelligible gallantry . <END>
<BEGIN> " it was the prospect of constant society , and good society he added , <END>
<BEGIN> " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire . i knew it to be a <END>
<BEGIN> most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me <END>
<BEGIN> farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great <END>
<BEGIN> attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them . <END>
<BEGIN> society , i own , is necessary to me . i have been a disappointed man , and <END>
<BEGIN> my spirits will not bear solitude . i _ must _ have employment and society . <END>
<BEGIN> a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have <END>
<BEGIN> now made it eligible . the church _ ought _ to have been my profession i <END>
<BEGIN> was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in <END>
<BEGIN> possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we <END>
<BEGIN> were speaking of just <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed <END>
<BEGIN> " yes the late mr . darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best <END>
<BEGIN> living in his gift . he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . <END>
<BEGIN> i cannot do justice to his kindness . he meant to provide for me amply , <END>
<BEGIN> and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " good heavens cried elizabeth ; " but how could _ that _ be how could <END>
<BEGIN> his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress <END>
<BEGIN> " there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to <END>
<BEGIN> give me no hope from law . a man of honour could not have doubted the <END>
<BEGIN> intention , but mr . darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely <END>
<BEGIN> conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim <END>
<BEGIN> to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . <END>
<BEGIN> certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i <END>
<BEGIN> was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no <END>
<BEGIN> less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done <END>
<BEGIN> any thing to deserve to lose it . i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i <END>
<BEGIN> may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too <END>
<BEGIN> freely . i can recal nothing worse . but the fact is , that we are very <END>
<BEGIN> different sort of men , and that he hates <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " some time or other he _ will _ be but it shall not be by _ me till i <END>
<BEGIN> can forget his father , i can never defy or expose <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than <END>
<BEGIN> ever as he expressed them . <END>
<BEGIN> " but what said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive what <END>
<BEGIN> can have induced him to behave so cruelly <END>
<BEGIN> " a thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but <END>
<BEGIN> attribute in some measure to jealousy . had the late mr . darcy liked me <END>
<BEGIN> less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ' s uncommon <END>
<BEGIN> attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life . he had not <END>
<BEGIN> a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of <END>
<BEGIN> preference which was often given <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i had not thought mr . darcy so bad as this though i have never liked <END>
<BEGIN> him , i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be <END>
<BEGIN> despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of <END>
<BEGIN> descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as <END>
<BEGIN> this <END>
<BEGIN> after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i _ do _ remember <END>
<BEGIN> his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his <END>
<BEGIN> resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . his disposition must <END>
<BEGIN> be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham , i _ can <END>
<BEGIN> hardly be just to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to <END>
<BEGIN> treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his <END>
<BEGIN> father she could have added , " a young man too , like _ you whose very <END>
<BEGIN> countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented <END>

<BEGIN> childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest <END>
<BEGIN> manner <END>
<BEGIN> " we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest <END>
<BEGIN> part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , <END>
<BEGIN> sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . _ my _ <END>
<BEGIN> father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr . philips , <END>

<BEGIN> to the late mr . darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the <END>

<BEGIN> intimate , confidential friend . mr . darcy often acknowledged himself to <END>
<BEGIN> be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active superintendance , <END>
<BEGIN> and when immediately before my father ' s death , mr . darcy gave him a <END>
<BEGIN> voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to <END>
<BEGIN> be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him as of affection to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " how strange cried elizabeth . " how abominable i wonder that the very <END>
<BEGIN> pride of this mr . darcy has not made him just to you if from no better <END>

<BEGIN> dishonesty i must call <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend . it has <END>
<BEGIN> connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . but we are none <END>
<BEGIN> of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <END>
<BEGIN> impulses even than <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good <END>
<BEGIN> " yes . it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his <END>
<BEGIN> money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve <END>
<BEGIN> the poor . family pride , and _ filial _ pride , for he is very proud of what <END>
<BEGIN> his father was , have done this . not to appear to disgrace his family , to <END>
<BEGIN> degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley house , is a powerful motive . he has also _ brotherly _ pride , <END>
<BEGIN> which with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful <END>
<BEGIN> guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the <END>
<BEGIN> most attentive and best of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " what sort of a girl is miss darcy <END>
<BEGIN> he shook his <URL> wish i could call her amiable . it gives me pain <END>
<BEGIN> to speak ill of a darcy . but she is too much like her brother very , <END>
<BEGIN> very <URL> a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and <END>
<BEGIN> extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her <END>
<BEGIN> amusement . but she is nothing to me now . she is a handsome girl , about <END>
<BEGIN> fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished . since her <END>
<BEGIN> father ' s death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , <END>
<BEGIN> and superintends her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not <END>
<BEGIN> help reverting once more to the first , and saying , <END>
<BEGIN> " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr . bingley ! how can mr . bingley , <END>
<BEGIN> who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , <END>
<BEGIN> be in friendship with such a man ? how can they suit each other do you <END>

<BEGIN> very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . his pride <END>
<BEGIN> never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , <END>
<BEGIN> sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable allowing <END>
<BEGIN> something for fortune and <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round <END>
<BEGIN> the other table , and mr . collins took his station between his cousin <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth and mrs . <URL> usual inquiries as to his success were <END>
<BEGIN> made by the latter . it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; <END>
<BEGIN> but when mrs . philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured <END>
<BEGIN> her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , <END>
<BEGIN> that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not <END>
<BEGIN> make herself uneasy . <END>
<BEGIN> " i know very well , madam said he , " that when persons sit down to a <END>
<BEGIN> card table , they must take their chance of these things and happily i <END>
<BEGIN> am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . there <END>

<BEGIN> catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding <END>
<BEGIN> little <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing mr . collins for <END>
<BEGIN> a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation <END>
<BEGIN> were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh . <END>
<BEGIN> " lady catherine de bourgh she replied , " has very lately given him a <END>
<BEGIN> living . i hardly know how mr . collins was first introduced to her <END>
<BEGIN> notice , but he certainly has not known her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy <END>
<BEGIN> were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr . <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no , indeed , i did <URL> knew nothing at all of lady catherine ' s <END>

<BEGIN> " her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is <END>
<BEGIN> believed that she and her cousin will unite the two <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss <END>
<BEGIN> bingley . vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her <END>
<BEGIN> affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already <END>
<BEGIN> self destined to another . <END>
<BEGIN> " mr . collins said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her <END>
<BEGIN> daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , <END>
<BEGIN> i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his <END>
<BEGIN> patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham ; " i have <END>
<BEGIN> not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked <END>
<BEGIN> her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . she has the <END>
<BEGIN> reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe <END>
<BEGIN> she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from <END>
<BEGIN> her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who <END>
<BEGIN> chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of <END>
<BEGIN> the first <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and <END>
<BEGIN> they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put <END>
<BEGIN> an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr . <END>
<BEGIN> wickham ' s attentions . there could be no conversation in the noise of <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every <END>
<BEGIN> body . whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <END>
<BEGIN> gracefully . elizabeth went away with her head full of him . she could <END>
<BEGIN> think of nothing but of mr . wickham , and of what he had told her , all <END>
<BEGIN> the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as <END>
<BEGIN> they went , for neither lydia nor mr . collins were once silent . lydia <END>
<BEGIN> talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the <END>
<BEGIN> fish she had won , and mr . collins , in describing the civility of mr . and <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses <END>
<BEGIN> at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing <END>
<BEGIN> that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage <END>
<BEGIN> before the carriage stopped at longbourn house . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xvii . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr . <END>
<BEGIN> wickham and herself . jane listened with astonishment and concern she <END>
<BEGIN> knew not how to believe that mr . darcy could be so unworthy of mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the <END>
<BEGIN> veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to <END>
<BEGIN> interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be <END>
<BEGIN> done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and <END>
<BEGIN> throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be <END>
<BEGIN> otherwise explained . <END>
<BEGIN> " they have both said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or <END>
<BEGIN> other , of which we can form no idea . interested people have perhaps <END>
<BEGIN> misrepresented each to the other . it is , in short , impossible for us to <END>
<BEGIN> conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , <END>
<BEGIN> without actual blame on either <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " very true , indeed and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in <END>
<BEGIN> behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the <END>
<BEGIN> business do clear _ them _ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my <END>
<BEGIN> opinion . my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light <END>
<BEGIN> it places mr . darcy , to be treating his father ' s favourite in such a <END>
<BEGIN> manner one , whom his father had promised to provide <URL> is <END>
<BEGIN> impossible . no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his <END>
<BEGIN> character , could be capable of it . can his most intimate friends be so <END>
<BEGIN> excessively deceived in him ? oh ! <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i can much more easily believe mr . bingley ' s being imposed on , than <END>
<BEGIN> that mr . wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me <END>
<BEGIN> last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without <URL> it <END>
<BEGIN> be not so , let mr . darcy contradict it . besides , there was truth in his <END>

<BEGIN> " it is difficult indeed it is <URL> does not know what to <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley , if he _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the <END>
<BEGIN> affair became public . <END>
<BEGIN> the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this <END>
<BEGIN> conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom <END>
<BEGIN> they had been speaking ; mr . bingley and his sisters came to give their <END>
<BEGIN> personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was <END>
<BEGIN> fixed for the following tuesday . the two ladies were delighted to see <END>
<BEGIN> their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and <END>
<BEGIN> repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their <END>
<BEGIN> separation . to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; <END>
<BEGIN> avoiding mrs . bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> and nothing at all to the others . they were soon gone again , rising from <END>
<BEGIN> their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and <END>
<BEGIN> hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs . bennet ' s civilities . <END>
<BEGIN> the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every <END>
<BEGIN> female of the family . mrs . bennet chose to consider it as given in <END>
<BEGIN> compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by <END>
<BEGIN> receiving the invitation from mr . bingley himself , instead of a <END>
<BEGIN> ceremonious card . jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the <END>
<BEGIN> society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr . <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr . darcy ' s <END>
<BEGIN> looks and behaviour . the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , <END>
<BEGIN> depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though <END>
<BEGIN> they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr . <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and <END>
<BEGIN> a ball was at any rate , a ball . and even mary could assure her family <END>
<BEGIN> that she had no disinclination for it . <END>
<BEGIN> " while i can have my mornings to myself said she , " it is <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . <END>
<BEGIN> society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who <END>
<BEGIN> consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did <END>
<BEGIN> not often speak unnecessarily to mr . collins , she could not help asking <END>
<BEGIN> him whether he intended to accept mr . bingley ' s invitation , and if he <END>
<BEGIN> did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s <END>
<BEGIN> amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no <END>
<BEGIN> scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke <END>
<BEGIN> either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to <END>
<BEGIN> dance . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am by no means of opinion , i assure you said he , " that a ball of <END>
<BEGIN> this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can <END>
<BEGIN> have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself <END>
<BEGIN> that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins <END>
<BEGIN> in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting <END>
<BEGIN> yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially a <END>
<BEGIN> preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right <END>
<BEGIN> cause , and not to any disrespect for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . she had fully proposed being <END>
<BEGIN> engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr . collins <END>
<BEGIN> instead ! her liveliness had been never worse timed . there was no help <END>
<BEGIN> for it however . mr . wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force <END>
<BEGIN> delayed a little longer , and mr . collins ' s proposal accepted with as <END>
<BEGIN> good a grace as she could . she was not the better pleased with his <END>
<BEGIN> gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something <URL> now first <END>
<BEGIN> struck her , that _ she _ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of <END>
<BEGIN> being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a <END>
<BEGIN> quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . <END>
<BEGIN> the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing <END>
<BEGIN> civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a <END>
<BEGIN> compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than <END>
<BEGIN> gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before <END>
<BEGIN> her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage <END>
<BEGIN> was exceedingly agreeable to _ her elizabeth however did not chuse to <END>
<BEGIN> take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the <END>
<BEGIN> consequence of any reply . mr . collins might never make the offer , and <END>
<BEGIN> till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . <END>
<BEGIN> if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the <END>
<BEGIN> younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , <END>
<BEGIN> for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was <END>
<BEGIN> such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once . no <END>
<BEGIN> aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after the very shoe roses <END>
<BEGIN> for netherfield were got by proxy . even elizabeth might have found some <END>
<BEGIN> trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the <END>
<BEGIN> improvement of her acquaintance with mr . wickham ; and nothing less than <END>
<BEGIN> a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and <END>
<BEGIN> monday , endurable to kitty and lydia . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xviii . <END>
<BEGIN> till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in <END>
<BEGIN> vain for mr . wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a <END>
<BEGIN> doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . the certainty of <END>
<BEGIN> meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that <END>
<BEGIN> might not unreasonably have alarmed her . she had dressed with more than <END>
<BEGIN> usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all <END>
<BEGIN> that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than <END>
<BEGIN> might be won in the course of the evening . but in an instant arose the <END>
<BEGIN> dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr . darcy ' s <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this <END>
<BEGIN> was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was <END>
<BEGIN> pronounced by his friend mr . denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and <END>
<BEGIN> who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business <END>
<BEGIN> the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant <END>
<BEGIN> smile , <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if <END>
<BEGIN> he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for <END>
<BEGIN> wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling <END>
<BEGIN> of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate <END>
<BEGIN> disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to <END>
<BEGIN> the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to <END>
<BEGIN> wickham . she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and <END>
<BEGIN> turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <END>
<BEGIN> surmount even in speaking to mr . bingley , whose blind partiality <END>
<BEGIN> provoked her . <END>
<BEGIN> but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect <END>
<BEGIN> of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her <END>
<BEGIN> spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had <END>
<BEGIN> not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to <END>
<BEGIN> the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular <END>
<BEGIN> notice . the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; <END>
<BEGIN> they were dances of mortification . mr . collins , awkward and solemn , <END>
<BEGIN> apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being <END>
<BEGIN> aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable <END>
<BEGIN> partner for a couple of dances can give . the moment of her release from <END>
<BEGIN> him was ecstacy . <END>
<BEGIN> she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . when those dances <END>
<BEGIN> were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with <END>
<BEGIN> her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr . darcy , who took <END>
<BEGIN> her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without <END>
<BEGIN> knowing what she did , she accepted him . he walked away again <END>
<BEGIN> immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of <END>
<BEGIN> mind ; charlotte tried to console her . <END>
<BEGIN> " i dare say you will find him very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " heaven forbid that _ would be the greatest misfortune of all to <END>
<BEGIN> find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me <END>
<BEGIN> such an <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her <END>
<BEGIN> hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a <END>
<BEGIN> simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant <END>
<BEGIN> in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . elizabeth made no <END>
<BEGIN> answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which <END>
<BEGIN> she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr . darcy , and <END>
<BEGIN> reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it . <END>
<BEGIN> they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to <END>
<BEGIN> imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at <END>
<BEGIN> first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would <END>
<BEGIN> be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made <END>
<BEGIN> some slight observation on the dance . he replied , and was again silent . <END>
<BEGIN> after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with <END>
<BEGIN> " it is _ your _ turn to say something now , mr . <URL> talked about <END>
<BEGIN> the dance , and _ you _ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of <END>
<BEGIN> the room , or the number of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be <END>
<BEGIN> said . <END>
<BEGIN> " very <URL> reply will do for the <URL> by and bye i <END>
<BEGIN> may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> _ now _ we may be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing <END>
<BEGIN> " sometimes . one must speak a little , you know . it would look odd to be <END>
<BEGIN> entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of <END>
<BEGIN> _ some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the <END>
<BEGIN> trouble of saying as little as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you <END>
<BEGIN> imagine that you are gratifying mine <END>
<BEGIN> " both replied elizabeth archly ; " for i have always seen a great <END>
<BEGIN> similarity in the turn of our <URL> are each of an unsocial , <END>
<BEGIN> taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say <END>
<BEGIN> something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to <END>
<BEGIN> posterity with all the eclat of a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure <END>
<BEGIN> said he . " how near it may be to _ mine i cannot pretend to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> think it a faithful portrait <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i must not decide on my own <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down <END>
<BEGIN> the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often <END>
<BEGIN> walk to meryton . she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist <END>
<BEGIN> the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just <END>
<BEGIN> been forming a new <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the effect was immediate . a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his <END>
<BEGIN> features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself <END>
<BEGIN> for her own weakness , could not go on . at length darcy spoke , and in a <END>
<BEGIN> constrained manner said , <END>
<BEGIN> " mr . wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his <END>
<BEGIN> _ making _ friends whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , <END>
<BEGIN> is less <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " he has been so unlucky as to lose _ your _ friendship replied elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all <END>
<BEGIN> his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . at <END>
<BEGIN> that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass <END>
<BEGIN> through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his <END>
<BEGIN> dancing and his partner . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir . such very <END>
<BEGIN> superior dancing is not often seen . it is evident that you belong to the <END>
<BEGIN> first circles . allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not <END>
<BEGIN> disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , <END>
<BEGIN> especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing <END>
<BEGIN> at her sister and bingley shall take place . what congratulations will <END>
<BEGIN> then flow in ! i appeal to mr . darcy but let me not interrupt you , <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching <END>
<BEGIN> converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir <END>
<BEGIN> william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his <END>
<BEGIN> eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and <END>
<BEGIN> jane , who were dancing together . recovering himself , however , shortly , <END>
<BEGIN> he turned to his partner , and said , <END>
<BEGIN> " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not think we were speaking at all . sir william could not have <END>
<BEGIN> interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for <END>

<BEGIN> success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " what think you of books said he , smiling . <END>
<BEGIN> " books oh ! <URL> am sure we never read the same , or not with the same <END>

<BEGIN> " i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be <END>
<BEGIN> no want of <URL> may compare our different <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no i cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of <END>
<BEGIN> something <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " the _ present _ always occupies you in such scenes does it said he , <END>
<BEGIN> with a look of doubt . <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , always she replied , without knowing what she said , for her <END>
<BEGIN> thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared <END>
<BEGIN> by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr . darcy , <END>
<BEGIN> that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was <END>
<BEGIN> unappeasable . you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its _ being <END>

<BEGIN> " i am said he , with a firm voice . <END>
<BEGIN> " and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice <END>

<BEGIN> to shake off her gravity . " i am trying to make it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and what is your success <END>
<BEGIN> she shook her head . " i do not get on at all . i hear such different <END>

<BEGIN> " i can readily believe answered he gravely , " that report may vary <END>
<BEGIN> greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were <END>
<BEGIN> not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to <END>
<BEGIN> fear that the performance would reflect no credit on <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied . <END>
<BEGIN> she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in <END>
<BEGIN> silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for <END>
<BEGIN> in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , <END>
<BEGIN> which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against <END>
<BEGIN> another . <END>
<BEGIN> they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with <END>
<BEGIN> an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , <END>
<BEGIN> " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george <END>
<BEGIN> wickham your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a <END>
<BEGIN> thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , <END>
<BEGIN> among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the <END>
<BEGIN> late mr . darcy ' s steward . let me recommend you , however , as a friend , <END>
<BEGIN> not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he <END>
<BEGIN> has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has <END>
<BEGIN> treated mr . darcy in a most infamous manner . i do not know the <END>
<BEGIN> particulars , but i know very well that mr . darcy is not in the least to <END>
<BEGIN> blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that <END>
<BEGIN> though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his <END>
<BEGIN> invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had <END>
<BEGIN> taken himself out of the way . his coming into the country at all , is a <END>
<BEGIN> most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it . <END>
<BEGIN> i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; <END>
<BEGIN> but really considering his descent , one could not expect much <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth angrily ; " for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse <END>
<BEGIN> than of being the son of mr . darcy ' s steward , and of _ that i can <END>
<BEGIN> assure you , he informed me <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i beg your pardon replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer . <END>
<BEGIN> " excuse my <URL> was kindly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " insolent girl said elizabeth to <URL> are much mistaken if <END>
<BEGIN> you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . i see <END>
<BEGIN> nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr . <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make <END>
<BEGIN> inquiries on the same subject of bingley . jane met her with a smile of <END>
<BEGIN> such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently <END>
<BEGIN> marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> instantly read her feelings , and at that moment <END>
<BEGIN> solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing <END>
<BEGIN> else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for <END>
<BEGIN> happiness . <END>
<BEGIN> " i want to know said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her <END>
<BEGIN> sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr . wickham . but perhaps you have <END>
<BEGIN> been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case <END>
<BEGIN> you may be sure of my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no replied jane , " i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing <END>
<BEGIN> satisfactory to tell you . mr . bingley does not know the whole of his <END>
<BEGIN> history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have <END>
<BEGIN> principally offended mr . darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , <END>
<BEGIN> the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham has deserved much less attention from mr . darcy than he has <END>
<BEGIN> received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his <END>
<BEGIN> sister ' s , mr . wickham is by no means a respectable young man . i am <END>
<BEGIN> afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr . darcy ' s <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " mr . bingley does not know mr . wickham himself <END>
<BEGIN> " no ; he never saw him till the other morning at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " this account then is what he has received from mr . darcy . i am <END>
<BEGIN> perfectly satisfied . but what does he say of the living <END>
<BEGIN> " he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard <END>
<BEGIN> them from mr . darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to <END>
<BEGIN> him _ conditionally _ <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i have not a doubt of mr . bingley ' s sincerity said elizabeth warmly ; <END>
<BEGIN> " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but <END>
<BEGIN> since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt <END>
<BEGIN> the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of <END>
<BEGIN> both gentlemen as i did <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on <END>
<BEGIN> which there could be no difference of sentiment . elizabeth listened with <END>
<BEGIN> delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of <END>
<BEGIN> bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence <END>
<BEGIN> in it . on their being joined by mr . bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew <END>
<BEGIN> to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last <END>
<BEGIN> partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . collins came up to them and <END>
<BEGIN> told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to <END>
<BEGIN> make a most important discovery . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have found out said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now <END>
<BEGIN> in the room a near relation of my patroness . i happened to overhear the <END>
<BEGIN> gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of <END>
<BEGIN> this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine . how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! who would <END>
<BEGIN> have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de <END>
<BEGIN> bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made <END>
<BEGIN> in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , <END>
<BEGIN> and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . my total <END>
<BEGIN> ignorance of the connection must plead my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed i am . i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . <END>
<BEGIN> i believe him to be lady catherine ' s _ nephew it will be in my power to <END>
<BEGIN> assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him <END>
<BEGIN> that mr . darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as <END>
<BEGIN> an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it <END>
<BEGIN> was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either <END>
<BEGIN> side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr . darcy , the superior in <END>
<BEGIN> consequence , to begin the <URL> collins listened to her <END>
<BEGIN> with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she <END>
<BEGIN> ceased speaking , replied thus , <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your <END>
<BEGIN> excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your <END>
<BEGIN> understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference <END>
<BEGIN> between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those <END>
<BEGIN> which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider <END>
<BEGIN> the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank <END>
<BEGIN> in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the <END>
<BEGIN> same time maintained . you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates <END>
<BEGIN> of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look <END>
<BEGIN> on as a point of duty . pardon me for neglecting to profit by your <END>
<BEGIN> advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though <END>
<BEGIN> in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and <END>
<BEGIN> habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> and with a low bow he left her to attack mr . darcy , whose <END>
<BEGIN> reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at <END>
<BEGIN> being so addressed was very evident . her cousin prefaced his speech with <END>
<BEGIN> a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if <END>
<BEGIN> hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology <END>
<BEGIN> " hunsford and " lady catherine de <URL> vexed her to see him <END>
<BEGIN> expose himself to such a man . mr . darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained <END>
<BEGIN> wonder , and when at last mr . collins allowed him time to speak , replied <END>
<BEGIN> with an air of distant civility . mr . collins , however , was not <END>
<BEGIN> discouraged from speaking again , and mr . darcy ' s contempt seemed <END>
<BEGIN> abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the <END>
<BEGIN> end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins then returned to elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have no reason , i assure you said he , " to be dissatisfied with my <END>
<BEGIN> reception . mr . darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . he answered <END>
<BEGIN> me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , <END>
<BEGIN> that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be <END>
<BEGIN> certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . it was really a very <END>
<BEGIN> handsome thought . upon the whole , i am much pleased with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned <END>
<BEGIN> her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr . bingley , and the <END>
<BEGIN> train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , <END>
<BEGIN> made her perhaps almost as happy as jane . she saw her in idea settled in <END>
<BEGIN> that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection <END>
<BEGIN> could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of <END>
<BEGIN> endeavouring even to like bingley ' s two sisters . her mother ' s thoughts <END>
<BEGIN> she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to <END>
<BEGIN> venture near her , lest she might hear too much . when they sat down to <END>
<BEGIN> supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which <END>
<BEGIN> placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find <END>
<BEGIN> that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , <END>
<BEGIN> openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be <END>
<BEGIN> soon married to mr . <URL> was an animating subject , and mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of <END>
<BEGIN> the match . his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living <END>
<BEGIN> but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation ; <END>
<BEGIN> and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of <END>
<BEGIN> jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as <END>
<BEGIN> she could do . it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger <END>
<BEGIN> daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of <END>
<BEGIN> other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be <END>
<BEGIN> able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that <END>
<BEGIN> she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . it was <END>
<BEGIN> necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on <END>
<BEGIN> such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life . she <END>
<BEGIN> concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally <END>
<BEGIN> fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no <END>
<BEGIN> chance of it . <END>
<BEGIN> in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s <END>
<BEGIN> words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible <END>
<BEGIN> whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the <END>
<BEGIN> chief of it was overheard by mr . darcy , who sat opposite to them . her <END>
<BEGIN> mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . <END>
<BEGIN> " what is mr . darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? i am <END>
<BEGIN> sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say <END>
<BEGIN> nothing _ he _ may not like to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak <URL> advantage can it be to you <END>
<BEGIN> to offend mr . darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by <END>
<BEGIN> so <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . her mother <END>
<BEGIN> would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . elizabeth blushed <END>
<BEGIN> and blushed again with shame and vexation . she could not help frequently <END>
<BEGIN> glancing her eye at mr . darcy , though every glance convinced her of what <END>
<BEGIN> she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was <END>
<BEGIN> convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . the expression <END>
<BEGIN> of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and <END>
<BEGIN> steady gravity . <END>
<BEGIN> at length however mrs . bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who <END>
<BEGIN> had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no <END>
<BEGIN> likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth now began to revive . but not long was the interval of <END>
<BEGIN> tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she <END>
<BEGIN> had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , <END>
<BEGIN> preparing to oblige the company . by many significant looks and silent <END>
<BEGIN> entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of <END>
<BEGIN> complaisance but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an <END>
<BEGIN> opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she <END>
<BEGIN> watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience <END>
<BEGIN> which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving <END>
<BEGIN> amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be <END>
<BEGIN> prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute <END>
<BEGIN> began another . mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; <END>
<BEGIN> her voice was weak , and her manner <URL> was in agonies . <END>
<BEGIN> she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly <END>
<BEGIN> talking to bingley . she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making <END>
<BEGIN> signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however <END>
<BEGIN> impenetrably grave . she looked at her father to entreat his <END>
<BEGIN> interference , lest mary should be singing all night . he took the hint , <END>
<BEGIN> and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , <END>
<BEGIN> " that will do extremely well , child . you have delighted us long enough . <END>
<BEGIN> let the other young ladies have time to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid <END>
<BEGIN> her anxiety had done no <URL> of the party were now applied to . <END>
<BEGIN> " if i said mr . collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i <END>
<BEGIN> should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an <END>
<BEGIN> air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> compatible with the profession of a <URL> do not mean however to <END>
<BEGIN> assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to <END>
<BEGIN> music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . the <END>
<BEGIN> rector of a parish has much to <URL> the first place , he must make <END>
<BEGIN> such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not <END>
<BEGIN> offensive to his patron . he must write his own sermons ; and the time <END>
<BEGIN> that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care <END>
<BEGIN> and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making <END>
<BEGIN> as comfortable as possible . and i do not think it of light importance <END>
<BEGIN> that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every <END>
<BEGIN> body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . i cannot <END>
<BEGIN> acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should <END>
<BEGIN> omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected <END>
<BEGIN> with the <URL> and with a bow to mr . darcy , he concluded his speech , <END>
<BEGIN> which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr . bennet <END>
<BEGIN> himself , while his wife seriously commended mr . collins for having <END>
<BEGIN> spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that <END>
<BEGIN> he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . <END>
<BEGIN> to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to <END>
<BEGIN> expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would <END>
<BEGIN> have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or <END>
<BEGIN> finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister <END>
<BEGIN> that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his <END>
<BEGIN> feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he <END>
<BEGIN> must have witnessed . that his two sisters and mr . darcy , however , should <END>
<BEGIN> have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and <END>
<BEGIN> she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or <END>
<BEGIN> the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . <END>
<BEGIN> the rest of the evening brought her little amusement . she was teazed by <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he <END>
<BEGIN> could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her <END>
<BEGIN> power to dance with others . in vain did she entreat him to stand up with <END>
<BEGIN> somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . <END>
<BEGIN> he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; <END>
<BEGIN> that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to <END>
<BEGIN> her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her <END>
<BEGIN> the whole evening . there was no arguing upon such a project . she owed <END>
<BEGIN> her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and <END>
<BEGIN> good naturedly engaged mr . collins ' s conversation to herself . <END>
<BEGIN> she was at least free from the offence of mr . darcy ' s farther notice ; <END>
<BEGIN> though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite <END>
<BEGIN> disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . she felt it to be the <END>
<BEGIN> probable consequence of her allusions to mr . wickham , and rejoiced in <END>
<BEGIN> it . <END>
<BEGIN> the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <END>
<BEGIN> manoeuvre of mrs . bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of <END>
<BEGIN> an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how <END>
<BEGIN> heartily they were wished away by some of the family . mrs . hurst and her <END>
<BEGIN> sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and <END>
<BEGIN> were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . they repulsed <END>
<BEGIN> every attempt of mrs . bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a <END>
<BEGIN> languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the <END>
<BEGIN> long speeches of mr . collins , who was complimenting mr . bingley and his <END>
<BEGIN> sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and <END>
<BEGIN> politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests . darcy said <END>
<BEGIN> nothing at all . mr . bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the <END>
<BEGIN> rest , and talked only to each other . elizabeth preserved as steady a <END>
<BEGIN> silence as either mrs . hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too <END>
<BEGIN> much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " lord , <END>
<BEGIN> how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn . <END>
<BEGIN> when at length they arose to take leave , mrs . bennet was most pressingly <END>
<BEGIN> civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and <END>
<BEGIN> addressed herself particularly to mr . bingley , to assure him how happy <END>
<BEGIN> he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , <END>
<BEGIN> without the ceremony of a formal invitation . bingley was all grateful <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of <END>
<BEGIN> waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to <END>
<BEGIN> go the next day for a short time . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the <END>
<BEGIN> delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of <END>
<BEGIN> settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly <END>
<BEGIN> see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four <END>
<BEGIN> months . of having another daughter married to mr . collins , she thought <END>
<BEGIN> with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the <END>
<BEGIN> man and the match were quite good enough for _ her the worth of each <END>
<BEGIN> was eclipsed by mr . bingley and netherfield . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xix . <END>
<BEGIN> the next day opened a new scene at longbourn . mr . collins made his <END>
<BEGIN> declaration in form . having resolved to do it without loss of time , as <END>
<BEGIN> his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having <END>
<BEGIN> no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the <END>
<BEGIN> moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the <END>
<BEGIN> observances which he supposed a regular part of the business . on finding <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon <END>
<BEGIN> after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , <END>
<BEGIN> " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the <END>
<BEGIN> course of this morning <END>
<BEGIN> before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet instantly answered , <END>
<BEGIN> " oh <URL> am sure lizzy will be very happy i am <END>
<BEGIN> sure she can have no <URL> kitty , i want you up <URL> and <END>
<BEGIN> gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> called out , <END>
<BEGIN> " dear ma ' am , do not <URL> beg you will not <URL> collins must excuse <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . i am <END>
<BEGIN> going away <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no , no , nonsense , <URL> desire you will stay where you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about <END>
<BEGIN> to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing <END>
<BEGIN> mr . <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment ' s <END>
<BEGIN> consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it <END>
<BEGIN> over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried <END>
<BEGIN> to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided <END>
<BEGIN> between distress and diversion . mrs . bennet and kitty walked off , and as <END>
<BEGIN> soon as they were gone mr . collins began . <END>
<BEGIN> " believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from <END>
<BEGIN> doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . you <END>
<BEGIN> would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little <END>
<BEGIN> unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected <END>
<BEGIN> mother ' s permission for this address . you can hardly doubt the purport <END>
<BEGIN> of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to <END>
<BEGIN> dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . almost as <END>
<BEGIN> soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my <END>
<BEGIN> future life . but before i am run away with by my feelings on this <END>
<BEGIN> subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for <END>
<BEGIN> marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of <END>
<BEGIN> selecting a wife , as i certainly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the idea of mr . collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away <END>
<BEGIN> with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not <END>
<BEGIN> use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and <END>
<BEGIN> he continued : <END>
<BEGIN> " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for <END>
<BEGIN> every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example <END>
<BEGIN> of matrimony in his parish . secondly , that i am convinced it will add <END>
<BEGIN> very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have <END>
<BEGIN> mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation <END>
<BEGIN> of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness . <END>
<BEGIN> twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too on this <END>
<BEGIN> subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left <END>
<BEGIN> hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while mrs . jenkinson was <END>
<BEGIN> arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot stool , that she said , ' mr . collins , you <END>
<BEGIN> must marry . a clergyman like you must <URL> properly , chuse a <END>
<BEGIN> gentlewoman for _ my _ sake ; and for your _ own let her be an active , <END>
<BEGIN> useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small <END>
<BEGIN> income go a good way . this is my advice . find such a woman as soon as <END>
<BEGIN> you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit <URL> allow me , by the <END>
<BEGIN> way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and <END>
<BEGIN> kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the <END>
<BEGIN> advantages in my power to offer . you will find her manners beyond any <END>
<BEGIN> thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be <END>
<BEGIN> acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect <END>
<BEGIN> which her rank will inevitably excite . thus much for my general <END>
<BEGIN> intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views <END>
<BEGIN> were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i <END>
<BEGIN> assure you there are many amiable young women . but the fact is , that <END>
<BEGIN> being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured <END>
<BEGIN> father , ( who , however , may live many years longer i could not satisfy <END>
<BEGIN> myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that <END>
<BEGIN> the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy <END>
<BEGIN> event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be <END>
<BEGIN> for several years . this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i <END>
<BEGIN> flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . and now nothing <END>
<BEGIN> remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the <END>
<BEGIN> violence of my affection . to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and <END>
<BEGIN> shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well <END>
<BEGIN> aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds <END>
<BEGIN> in the 4 per cents . which will not be yours till after your mother ' s <END>
<BEGIN> decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . on that head , <END>
<BEGIN> therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that <END>
<BEGIN> no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . <END>
<BEGIN> " you are too hasty , sir she cried . " you forget that i have made no <END>
<BEGIN> answer . let me do it without farther loss of time . accept my thanks for <END>
<BEGIN> the compliment you are paying me . i am very sensible of the honour of <END>
<BEGIN> your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline <END>

<BEGIN> " i am not now to learn replied mr . collins , with a formal wave of the <END>
<BEGIN> hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the <END>
<BEGIN> man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their <END>
<BEGIN> favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a <END>
<BEGIN> third time . i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just <END>
<BEGIN> said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " upon my word , sir cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an <END>
<BEGIN> extraordinary one after my declaration . i do assure you that i am not <END>

<BEGIN> happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who <END>

<BEGIN> am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr . collins <END>
<BEGIN> very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <END>
<BEGIN> disapprove of you . and you may be certain that when i have the honour of <END>
<BEGIN> seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , <END>
<BEGIN> economy , and other amiable <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed , mr . collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . you must <END>
<BEGIN> give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of <END>
<BEGIN> believing what i say . i wish you very happy and very rich , and by <END>
<BEGIN> refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . <END>
<BEGIN> in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your <END>
<BEGIN> feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn <END>
<BEGIN> estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach . this matter may be <END>
<BEGIN> considered , therefore , as finally <URL> and rising as she thus <END>
<BEGIN> spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr . collins thus <END>
<BEGIN> addressed her , <END>
<BEGIN> " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i <END>
<BEGIN> shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given <END>
<BEGIN> me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i <END>
<BEGIN> know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the <END>
<BEGIN> first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to <END>
<BEGIN> encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the <END>
<BEGIN> female <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " really , mr . collins cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me <END>
<BEGIN> exceedingly . if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form <END>
<BEGIN> of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as <END>
<BEGIN> may convince you of its being <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your <END>
<BEGIN> refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . my reasons for <END>
<BEGIN> believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand <END>
<BEGIN> is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would <END>
<BEGIN> be any other than highly desirable . my situation in life , my connections <END>
<BEGIN> with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are <END>
<BEGIN> circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther <END>
<BEGIN> consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no <END>
<BEGIN> means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . your <END>
<BEGIN> portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the <END>
<BEGIN> effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . as i must <END>
<BEGIN> therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i <END>
<BEGIN> shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by <END>
<BEGIN> suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind <END>
<BEGIN> of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . i would <END>
<BEGIN> rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . i thank you <END>
<BEGIN> again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but <END>
<BEGIN> to accept them is absolutely impossible . my feelings in every respect <END>
<BEGIN> forbid it . can i speak plainer ? do not consider me now as an elegant <END>
<BEGIN> female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the <END>
<BEGIN> truth from her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are uniformly charming cried he , with an air of awkward <END>
<BEGIN> gallantry ; " and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express <END>

<BEGIN> being <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no <END>
<BEGIN> reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he <END>
<BEGIN> persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering <END>
<BEGIN> encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered <END>
<BEGIN> in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could <END>
<BEGIN> not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xx . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his <END>
<BEGIN> successful love ; for mrs . bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule <END>
<BEGIN> to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the <END>
<BEGIN> door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she <END>
<BEGIN> entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in <END>
<BEGIN> warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . mr . collins <END>
<BEGIN> received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then <END>
<BEGIN> proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result <END>
<BEGIN> of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the <END>
<BEGIN> refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow <END>
<BEGIN> from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . <END>
<BEGIN> this information , however , startled mrs . bennet she would have been <END>
<BEGIN> glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage <END>
<BEGIN> him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe <END>
<BEGIN> it , and could not help saying so . <END>
<BEGIN> " but depend upon it , mr . collins she added , " that lizzy shall be <END>
<BEGIN> brought to reason . i will speak to her about it myself directly . she is <END>
<BEGIN> a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but <END>
<BEGIN> i will _ make _ her know <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " pardon me for interrupting you , madam cried mr . collins ; " but if she <END>
<BEGIN> is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would <END>
<BEGIN> altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who <END>
<BEGIN> naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . if therefore she <END>
<BEGIN> actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to <END>
<BEGIN> force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of <END>
<BEGIN> temper , she could not contribute much to my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " sir , you quite misunderstand me said mrs . bennet , alarmed . " lizzy is <END>
<BEGIN> only headstrong in such matters as these . in every thing else she is as <END>
<BEGIN> good natured a girl as ever lived . i will go directly to mr . bennet , and <END>
<BEGIN> we shall very soon settle it with her , i am <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her <END>
<BEGIN> husband , called out as she entered the library , <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! mr . bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . <END>
<BEGIN> you must come and make lizzy marry mr . collins , for she vows she will <END>
<BEGIN> not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and <END>
<BEGIN> not have <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them <END>
<BEGIN> on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by <END>
<BEGIN> her communication . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he , when she had <END>
<BEGIN> finished her speech . " of what are you talking <END>
<BEGIN> " of mr . collins and lizzy . lizzy declares she will not have mr . collins , <END>
<BEGIN> and mr . collins begins to say that he will not have <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " speak to lizzy about it yourself . tell her that you insist upon her <END>
<BEGIN> marrying <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " let her be called down . she shall hear my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the <END>
<BEGIN> library . <END>
<BEGIN> " come here , child cried her father as she appeared . " i have sent for <END>
<BEGIN> you on an affair of importance . i understand that mr . collins has made <END>
<BEGIN> you an offer of marriage . is it true elizabeth replied that it was . <END>
<BEGIN> " very well and this offer of marriage you have refused <END>
<BEGIN> " i have , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " very well . we now come to the point . your mother insists upon your <END>
<BEGIN> accepting it . is not it so , mrs . bennet <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , or i will never see her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth . from this day you must <END>
<BEGIN> be a stranger to one of your <URL> mother will never see you <END>
<BEGIN> again if you do _ not _ marry mr . collins , and i will never see you again <END>
<BEGIN> if you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; <END>
<BEGIN> but mrs . bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the <END>
<BEGIN> affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . <END>
<BEGIN> " what do you mean , mr . bennet , by talking in this way ? you promised me <END>
<BEGIN> to _ insist _ upon her marrying <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request . <END>
<BEGIN> first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the <END>
<BEGIN> present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . i shall be glad to have the <END>
<BEGIN> library to myself as soon as may <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet give up the point . she talked to elizabeth again and again ; <END>
<BEGIN> coaxed and threatened her by turns . she endeavoured to secure jane in <END>
<BEGIN> her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined <END>
<BEGIN> interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and <END>
<BEGIN> sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . though her manner <END>
<BEGIN> varied however , her determination never did . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . <END>
<BEGIN> he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin <END>
<BEGIN> could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other <END>
<BEGIN> way . his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her <END>
<BEGIN> deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . <END>
<BEGIN> while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend <END>
<BEGIN> the day with them . she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to <END>
<BEGIN> her , cried in a half whisper , " i am glad you are come , for there is such <END>
<BEGIN> fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr . collins has <END>
<BEGIN> made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , <END>
<BEGIN> who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the <END>
<BEGIN> breakfast room , where mrs . bennet was alone , than she likewise began on <END>
<BEGIN> the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating <END>
<BEGIN> her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her <END>
<BEGIN> family . " pray do , my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone , <END>
<BEGIN> " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , <END>
<BEGIN> nobody feels for my poor <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> " aye , there she comes continued mrs . bennet , " looking as unconcerned <END>
<BEGIN> as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided <END>
<BEGIN> she can have her own <URL> i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take <END>
<BEGIN> it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , <END>
<BEGIN> you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is <END>
<BEGIN> to maintain you when your father is <URL> shall not be able to keep <END>
<BEGIN> you and so i warn <URL> have done with you from this very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you <END>
<BEGIN> again , and you will find me as good as my word . i have no pleasure in <END>
<BEGIN> talking to undutiful <URL> that i have much pleasure indeed in <END>
<BEGIN> talking to any body . people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints <END>
<BEGIN> can have no great inclination for talking . nobody can tell what i <END>
<BEGIN> suffer but it is always so . those who do not complain are never <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any <END>
<BEGIN> attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation . <END>
<BEGIN> she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till <END>
<BEGIN> they were joined by mr . collins , who entered with an air more stately <END>
<BEGIN> than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , <END>
<BEGIN> " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and <END>
<BEGIN> let mr . collins and me have a little conversation <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but <END>
<BEGIN> lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , <END>
<BEGIN> detained first by the civility of mr . collins , whose inquiries after <END>
<BEGIN> herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little <END>
<BEGIN> curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending <END>
<BEGIN> not to hear . in a doleful voice mrs . bennet thus began the projected <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> mr . collins <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear madam replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . <END>
<BEGIN> far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his <END>
<BEGIN> displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . resignation to <END>
<BEGIN> inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man <END>
<BEGIN> who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i <END>
<BEGIN> trust i am resigned . perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my <END>
<BEGIN> positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i <END>
<BEGIN> have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the <END>
<BEGIN> blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . <END>
<BEGIN> you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your <END>
<BEGIN> family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your <END>
<BEGIN> daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and mr . bennet the <END>
<BEGIN> compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . <END>
<BEGIN> my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission <END>
<BEGIN> from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own . but we are all liable to <END>
<BEGIN> error . i have certainly meant well through the whole affair . my object <END>
<BEGIN> has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due <END>
<BEGIN> consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _ manner _ <END>
<BEGIN> has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xxi . <END>
<BEGIN> the discussion of mr . collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily <END>
<BEGIN> attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . <END>
<BEGIN> as for the gentleman himself , _ his _ feelings were chiefly expressed , not <END>
<BEGIN> by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by <END>
<BEGIN> stiffness of manner and resentful silence . he scarcely ever spoke to <END>
<BEGIN> her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of <END>
<BEGIN> himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose <END>
<BEGIN> civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and <END>
<BEGIN> especially to her friend . <END>
<BEGIN> the morrow produced no abatement of mrs . bennet ' s ill humour or ill <END>
<BEGIN> health . mr . collins was also in the same state of angry pride . elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did <END>
<BEGIN> not appear in the least affected by it . he was always to have gone on <END>
<BEGIN> saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay . <END>
<BEGIN> after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr . wickham <END>
<BEGIN> were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball . <END>
<BEGIN> he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their <END>
<BEGIN> aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was <END>
<BEGIN> well talked <URL> elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged <END>
<BEGIN> that the necessity of his absence _ had _ been self imposed . <END>
<BEGIN> " i found said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so <END>
<BEGIN> many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes <END>
<BEGIN> might arise unpleasant to more than <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full <END>
<BEGIN> discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly <END>
<BEGIN> bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with <END>
<BEGIN> them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . <END>
<BEGIN> his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the <END>
<BEGIN> compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an <END>
<BEGIN> occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . <END>
<BEGIN> soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came <END>
<BEGIN> from netherfield , and was opened immediately . the envelope contained a <END>
<BEGIN> sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s <END>
<BEGIN> fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as <END>
<BEGIN> she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . <END>
<BEGIN> jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to <END>
<BEGIN> join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention <END>
<BEGIN> even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , <END>
<BEGIN> than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs . when they <END>
<BEGIN> had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , <END>
<BEGIN> " this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a <END>
<BEGIN> good deal . the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are <END>
<BEGIN> on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . <END>
<BEGIN> you shall hear what she <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information <END>
<BEGIN> of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , <END>
<BEGIN> and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr . <END>
<BEGIN> hurst had a house . the next was in these words . " i do not pretend to <END>
<BEGIN> regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my <END>
<BEGIN> dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many <END>
<BEGIN> returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean <END>
<BEGIN> while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most <END>
<BEGIN> unreserved correspondence . i depend on you for <URL> to these high <END>
<BEGIN> flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of <END>
<BEGIN> distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she <END>
<BEGIN> saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their <END>
<BEGIN> absence from netherfield would prevent mr . bingley ' s being there ; and as <END>
<BEGIN> to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon <END>
<BEGIN> cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . <END>
<BEGIN> " it is unlucky said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be <END>
<BEGIN> able to see your friends before they leave the country . but may we not <END>
<BEGIN> hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks <END>
<BEGIN> forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful <END>
<BEGIN> intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater <END>
<BEGIN> satisfaction as sisters mr . bingley will not be detained in london by <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into <END>
<BEGIN> hertfordshire this winter . i will read it to you <END>
<BEGIN> " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which <END>
<BEGIN> took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we <END>
<BEGIN> are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when <END>
<BEGIN> charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have <END>
<BEGIN> determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend <END>
<BEGIN> his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . many of my acquaintance are <END>
<BEGIN> already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest <END>
<BEGIN> friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i <END>
<BEGIN> despair . i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in <END>
<BEGIN> the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux <END>

<BEGIN> but you do not know _ all i _ will _ read you the passage which <END>
<BEGIN> particularly hurts me . i will have no reserves from <URL> " mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _ we _ are <END>
<BEGIN> scarcely less eager to meet her again . i really do not think georgiana <END>
<BEGIN> darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the <END>
<BEGIN> affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into <END>
<BEGIN> something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of <END>
<BEGIN> her being hereafter our sister . i do not know whether i ever before <END>
<BEGIN> mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the <END>
<BEGIN> country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them <END>
<BEGIN> unreasonable . my brother admires her greatly already , he will have <END>
<BEGIN> frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her <END>
<BEGIN> relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s <END>
<BEGIN> partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most <END>
<BEGIN> capable of engaging any woman ' s heart . with all these circumstances to <END>
<BEGIN> favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest <END>
<BEGIN> jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness <END>
<BEGIN> of so many <END>
<BEGIN> " what think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear lizzy said jane as she <END>
<BEGIN> finished it . " is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare <END>
<BEGIN> that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she <END>
<BEGIN> is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she <END>

<BEGIN> degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on <END>
<BEGIN> tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of <END>
<BEGIN> being in love with you , he is very much in love with her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane , " your <END>
<BEGIN> representation of all this , might make me quite easy . but i know the <END>
<BEGIN> foundation is unjust . caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any <END>
<BEGIN> one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is <URL> could not have started a more happy idea , since you <END>
<BEGIN> will not take comfort in mine . believe her to be deceived by all means . <END>
<BEGIN> you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in <END>
<BEGIN> accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry <END>
<BEGIN> elsewhere <END>
<BEGIN> " you must decide for yourself said elizabeth , " and if upon mature <END>
<BEGIN> deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is <END>
<BEGIN> more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by <END>
<BEGIN> all means to refuse <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that <END>
<BEGIN> though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could <END>
<BEGIN> not <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i did not think you would and that being the case , i cannot consider <END>
<BEGIN> your situation with much <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be <END>
<BEGIN> required . a thousand things may arise in six months <END>
<BEGIN> the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost <END>
<BEGIN> contempt . it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s <END>
<BEGIN> interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those <END>
<BEGIN> wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man <END>
<BEGIN> so totally independent of every one . <END>
<BEGIN> she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on <END>
<BEGIN> the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . <END>
<BEGIN> jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , <END>
<BEGIN> though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that <END>
<BEGIN> bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . <END>
<BEGIN> they agreed that mrs . bennet should only hear of the departure of the <END>
<BEGIN> family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; <END>
<BEGIN> but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , <END>
<BEGIN> and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen <END>
<BEGIN> to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . after <END>
<BEGIN> lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking <END>
<BEGIN> that mr . bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , <END>
<BEGIN> and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though <END>
<BEGIN> he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have <END>
<BEGIN> two full courses . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xxii . <END>
<BEGIN> the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the <END>
<BEGIN> chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr . collins . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . " it keeps him in good <END>
<BEGIN> humour said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and <END>
<BEGIN> that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . this was <END>
<BEGIN> very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> had any conception of its object was nothing less , than to secure her <END>
<BEGIN> from any return of mr . collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards <END>
<BEGIN> herself . such was miss lucas ' s scheme ; and appearances were so <END>
<BEGIN> favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost <END>
<BEGIN> sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon . <END>
<BEGIN> but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his <END>
<BEGIN> character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next <END>
<BEGIN> morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw <END>
<BEGIN> himself at her feet . he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , <END>
<BEGIN> from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to <END>
<BEGIN> conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known <END>
<BEGIN> till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost <END>
<BEGIN> secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , <END>
<BEGIN> he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday . his <END>
<BEGIN> reception however was of the most flattering kind . miss lucas perceived <END>
<BEGIN> him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly <END>
<BEGIN> set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . but little had she dared <END>
<BEGIN> to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . <END>
<BEGIN> in as short a time as mr . collins ' s long speeches would allow , every <END>
<BEGIN> thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they <END>
<BEGIN> entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was <END>
<BEGIN> to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be <END>
<BEGIN> waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his <END>
<BEGIN> happiness . the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must <END>
<BEGIN> guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its <END>
<BEGIN> continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and <END>
<BEGIN> disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that <END>
<BEGIN> establishment were gained . <END>
<BEGIN> sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; <END>
<BEGIN> and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . mr . collins ' s present <END>
<BEGIN> circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom <END>
<BEGIN> they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were <END>
<BEGIN> exceedingly fair . lady lucas began directly to calculate with more <END>
<BEGIN> interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided <END>
<BEGIN> opinion , that whenever mr . collins should be in possession of the <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife <END>
<BEGIN> should make their appearance at st . james ' s . the whole family in short <END>
<BEGIN> were properly overjoyed on the occasion . the younger girls formed hopes <END>
<BEGIN> of _ coming out _ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have <END>
<BEGIN> done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s <END>
<BEGIN> dying an old maid . charlotte herself was tolerably composed . she had <END>
<BEGIN> gained her point , and had time to consider of it . her reflections were <END>
<BEGIN> in general satisfactory . mr . collins to be sure was neither sensible nor <END>
<BEGIN> agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be <END>
<BEGIN> imaginary . but still he would be her <URL> thinking highly <END>
<BEGIN> either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it <END>
<BEGIN> was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small <END>
<BEGIN> fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their <END>
<BEGIN> pleasantest preservative from want . this preservative she had now <END>
<BEGIN> obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been <END>
<BEGIN> handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . the least agreeable <END>
<BEGIN> circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other <END>
<BEGIN> person . elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though <END>
<BEGIN> her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such <END>
<BEGIN> disapprobation . she resolved to give her the information herself , and <END>
<BEGIN> therefore charged mr . collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , <END>
<BEGIN> to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . a promise <END>
<BEGIN> of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept <END>
<BEGIN> without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst <END>
<BEGIN> forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some <END>
<BEGIN> ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great <END>
<BEGIN> self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . <END>
<BEGIN> as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the <END>
<BEGIN> family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved <END>
<BEGIN> for the night ; and mrs . bennet with great politeness and cordiality said <END>
<BEGIN> how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his <END>
<BEGIN> other engagements might allow him to visit them . <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear madam he replied , " this invitation is particularly <END>
<BEGIN> gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you <END>
<BEGIN> may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> they were all astonished ; and mr . bennet , who could by no means wish for <END>
<BEGIN> so speedy a return , immediately said , <END>
<BEGIN> " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my <END>
<BEGIN> good sir you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of <END>
<BEGIN> offending your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear sir replied mr . collins , " i am particularly obliged to you <END>
<BEGIN> for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so <END>
<BEGIN> material a step without her ladyship ' s <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you cannot be too much on your guard . risk any thing rather than her <END>
<BEGIN> displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us <END>
<BEGIN> again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , <END>
<BEGIN> and be satisfied that _ we _ shall take no <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such <END>
<BEGIN> affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive <END>
<BEGIN> from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of <END>
<BEGIN> your regard during my stay in hertfordshire . as for my fair cousins , <END>
<BEGIN> though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall <END>
<BEGIN> now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting <END>
<BEGIN> my cousin <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally <END>
<BEGIN> surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . mrs . bennet wished <END>
<BEGIN> to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of <END>
<BEGIN> her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . <END>
<BEGIN> she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a <END>
<BEGIN> solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no <END>
<BEGIN> means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and <END>
<BEGIN> improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very <END>
<BEGIN> agreeable companion . but on the following morning , every hope of this <END>
<BEGIN> kind was done away . miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a <END>
<BEGIN> private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before . <END>
<BEGIN> the possibility of mr . collins ' s fancying himself in love with her <END>
<BEGIN> friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but <END>
<BEGIN> that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from <END>
<BEGIN> possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her <END>
<BEGIN> astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <END>
<BEGIN> bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , <END>
<BEGIN> " engaged to mr . collins ! my dear charlotte impossible <END>
<BEGIN> the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her <END>
<BEGIN> story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a <END>
<BEGIN> reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon <END>
<BEGIN> regained her composure , and calmly replied , <END>
<BEGIN> " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza do you think it incredible <END>
<BEGIN> that mr . collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , <END>
<BEGIN> because he was not so happy as to succeed with you <END>
<BEGIN> but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort <END>
<BEGIN> for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect <END>
<BEGIN> of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished <END>
<BEGIN> her all imaginable happiness . <END>
<BEGIN> " i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be <END>
<BEGIN> surprised , very much surprised so lately as mr . collins was wishing to <END>
<BEGIN> marry you . but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you <END>
<BEGIN> will be satisfied with what i have done . i am not romantic you know . i <END>
<BEGIN> never was . i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr . collins ' s <END>
<BEGIN> character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my <END>
<BEGIN> chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on <END>
<BEGIN> entering the marriage <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly and after an awkward pause , <END>
<BEGIN> they returned to the rest of the family . charlotte did not stay much <END>
<BEGIN> longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . it <END>
<BEGIN> was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so <END>
<BEGIN> unsuitable a match . the strangeness of mr . collins ' s making two offers <END>
<BEGIN> of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being <END>
<BEGIN> now accepted . she had always felt that charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony <END>
<BEGIN> was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it <END>
<BEGIN> possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every <END>
<BEGIN> better feeling to worldly advantage . charlotte the wife of mr . collins , <END>
<BEGIN> was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing <END>
<BEGIN> herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction <END>
<BEGIN> that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot <END>
<BEGIN> she had chosen . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xxiii . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what <END>
<BEGIN> she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , <END>
<BEGIN> when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to <END>
<BEGIN> announce her engagement to the family . with many compliments to them , <END>
<BEGIN> and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the <END>
<BEGIN> houses , he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering , <END>
<BEGIN> but incredulous ; for mrs . bennet , with more perseverance than <END>
<BEGIN> politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always <END>
<BEGIN> unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , <END>
<BEGIN> " good lord ! sir william , how can you tell such a story do not you know <END>
<BEGIN> that mr . collins wants to marry lizzy <END>
<BEGIN> nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne <END>
<BEGIN> without anger such treatment ; but sir william ' s good breeding carried <END>
<BEGIN> him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the <END>
<BEGIN> truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the <END>
<BEGIN> most forbearing courtesy . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant <END>
<BEGIN> a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by <END>
<BEGIN> mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and <END>
<BEGIN> endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , <END>
<BEGIN> by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she <END>
<BEGIN> was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the <END>
<BEGIN> happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character <END>
<BEGIN> of mr . collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while <END>
<BEGIN> sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings <END>
<BEGIN> found a rapid vent . in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving <END>
<BEGIN> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr . collins <END>
<BEGIN> had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy <END>
<BEGIN> together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off . two <END>
<BEGIN> inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that <END>
<BEGIN> she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two <END>
<BEGIN> points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . nothing could <END>
<BEGIN> console and nothing appease <URL> did that day wear out her <END>
<BEGIN> resentment . a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without <END>
<BEGIN> scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william <END>
<BEGIN> or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she <END>
<BEGIN> could at all forgive their daughter . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such <END>
<BEGIN> as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for <END>
<BEGIN> it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had <END>
<BEGIN> been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and <END>
<BEGIN> more foolish than his daughter ! <END>
<BEGIN> jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said <END>
<BEGIN> less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; <END>
<BEGIN> nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . kitty and <END>
<BEGIN> lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr . collins was only a <END>
<BEGIN> clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news <END>
<BEGIN> to spread at meryton . <END>
<BEGIN> lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she <END>
<BEGIN> called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , <END>
<BEGIN> though mrs . bennet ' s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been <END>
<BEGIN> enough to drive happiness away . <END>
<BEGIN> between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <END>
<BEGIN> mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no <END>
<BEGIN> real confidence could ever subsist between them again . her <END>
<BEGIN> disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her <END>
<BEGIN> sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could <END>
<BEGIN> never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as <END>
<BEGIN> bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . <END>
<BEGIN> jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting <END>
<BEGIN> the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . the promised <END>
<BEGIN> letter of thanks from mr . collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their <END>
<BEGIN> father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a <END>
<BEGIN> twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted . after discharging <END>
<BEGIN> his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many <END>
<BEGIN> rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection <END>
<BEGIN> of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was <END>
<BEGIN> merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready <END>
<BEGIN> to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither <END>
<BEGIN> he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , <END>
<BEGIN> he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take <END>
<BEGIN> place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable <END>
<BEGIN> argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him <END>
<BEGIN> the happiest of men . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins ' s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure to mrs . bennet . on the contrary she was as much disposed to <END>
<BEGIN> complain of it as her <URL> was very strange that he should come <END>
<BEGIN> to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient <END>
<BEGIN> and exceedingly <URL> hated having visitors in the house <END>
<BEGIN> while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the <END>
<BEGIN> most disagreeable . such were the gentle murmurs of mrs . bennet , and they <END>
<BEGIN> gave way only to the greater distress of mr . bingley ' s continued <END>
<BEGIN> absence . <END>
<BEGIN> neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . day after <END>
<BEGIN> day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the <END>
<BEGIN> report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to <END>
<BEGIN> netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous <END>
<BEGIN> falsehood . <END>
<BEGIN> even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that <END>
<BEGIN> his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . unwilling as she <END>
<BEGIN> was to admit an idea so destructive of jane ' s happiness , and so <END>
<BEGIN> dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its <END>
<BEGIN> frequently recurring . the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters <END>
<BEGIN> and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss <END>
<BEGIN> darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for <END>
<BEGIN> the strength of his attachment . <END>
<BEGIN> as for jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more <END>
<BEGIN> painful than elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <END>
<BEGIN> concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject <END>
<BEGIN> was never alluded to . but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an <END>
<BEGIN> hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her <END>
<BEGIN> impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he <END>
<BEGIN> did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . it needed all <END>
<BEGIN> jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable <END>
<BEGIN> tranquillity . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his <END>
<BEGIN> reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his <END>
<BEGIN> first introduction . he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; <END>
<BEGIN> and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them <END>
<BEGIN> from a great deal of his company . the chief of every day was spent by <END>
<BEGIN> him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time <END>
<BEGIN> to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet was really in a most pitiable state . the very mention of any <END>
<BEGIN> thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and <END>
<BEGIN> wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . the sight of <END>
<BEGIN> miss lucas was odious to her . as her successor in that house , she <END>
<BEGIN> regarded her with jealous abhorrence . whenever charlotte came to see <END>
<BEGIN> them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and <END>
<BEGIN> whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr . collins , was convinced that <END>
<BEGIN> they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself <END>
<BEGIN> and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr . bennet were dead . she <END>
<BEGIN> complained bitterly of all this to her husband . <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed , mr . bennet said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte <END>
<BEGIN> lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to <END>
<BEGIN> make way for _ her and live to see her take my place in it <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . let us hope for <END>
<BEGIN> better things . let us flatter ourselves that _ i _ may be the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this was not very consoling to mrs . bennet , and , therefore , instead of <END>
<BEGIN> making any answer , she went on as before , <END>
<BEGIN> " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . if it was <END>
<BEGIN> not for the entail i should not mind <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " what should not you mind <END>
<BEGIN> " i should not mind any thing at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i never can be thankful , mr . bennet , for any thing about the entail . <END>
<BEGIN> how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from <END>
<BEGIN> one ' s own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins too why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else <END>

<BEGIN> time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left <END>
<BEGIN> the country . <END>
<BEGIN> hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of <END>
<BEGIN> the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the <END>
<BEGIN> writer , that could give her any comfort . miss darcy ' s praise occupied <END>

<BEGIN> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former <END>
<BEGIN> letter . she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <END>

<BEGIN> the latter with regard to new furniture . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , <END>
<BEGIN> heard it in silent indignation . her heart was divided between concern <END>
<BEGIN> for her sister , and resentment against all the others . to caroline ' s <END>
<BEGIN> assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no <END>
<BEGIN> credit . that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she <END>
<BEGIN> had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she <END>
<BEGIN> could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness <END>
<BEGIN> of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave <END>
<BEGIN> of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to <END>
<BEGIN> the caprice of their inclinations . had his own happiness , however , been <END>
<BEGIN> the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what <END>
<BEGIN> ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she <END>
<BEGIN> thought he must be sensible himself . it was a subject , in short , on <END>
<BEGIN> which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . she <END>

<BEGIN> died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he <END>
<BEGIN> had been aware of jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his <END>
<BEGIN> observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be <END>
<BEGIN> materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained <END>
<BEGIN> the same , her peace equally wounded . <END>
<BEGIN> a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ; but at last on mrs . bennet ' s leaving them together , after a <END>
<BEGIN> longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could <END>
<BEGIN> not help saying , <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no <END>
<BEGIN> idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . but i <END>
<BEGIN> will not repine . it cannot last long . he will be forgot , and we shall <END>
<BEGIN> all be as we were <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said <END>
<BEGIN> nothing . <END>
<BEGIN> " you doubt me cried jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no <END>
<BEGIN> reason . he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance , but that is all . i have nothing either to hope or fear , <END>
<BEGIN> and nothing to reproach him with . thank god ! i have not _ that _ pain . a <END>
<BEGIN> little time <URL> shall certainly try to get the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , <END>
<BEGIN> that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it <END>
<BEGIN> has done no harm to any one but <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth , " you are too good . your sweetness <END>
<BEGIN> and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to <END>
<BEGIN> you . i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back <END>
<BEGIN> the praise on her sister ' s warm affection . <END>
<BEGIN> " nay said elizabeth , " this is not fair . _ you _ wish to think all the <END>
<BEGIN> world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body . _ i _ only <END>
<BEGIN> want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it . do not be <END>
<BEGIN> afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your <END>
<BEGIN> privilege of universal good will . you need not . there are few people <END>
<BEGIN> whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well . the more i see <END>
<BEGIN> of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms <END>
<BEGIN> my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the <END>
<BEGIN> little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit <END>
<BEGIN> or sense . i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; <END>
<BEGIN> the other is charlotte ' s marriage . it is unaccountable ! in every view it <END>
<BEGIN> is unaccountable <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . they will <END>
<BEGIN> ruin your happiness . you do not make allowance enough for difference of <END>
<BEGIN> situation and temper . consider mr . collins ' s respectability , and <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte ' s prudent , steady character . remember that she is one of a <END>
<BEGIN> large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be <END>
<BEGIN> ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something <END>
<BEGIN> like regard and esteem for our <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else <END>
<BEGIN> could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her <END>
<BEGIN> understanding , than i now do of her heart . my dear jane , mr . collins is <END>
<BEGIN> a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well <END>
<BEGIN> as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries <END>
<BEGIN> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . you shall not defend her , <END>
<BEGIN> though it is charlotte lucas . you shall not , for the sake of one <END>
<BEGIN> individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor <END>
<BEGIN> endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and <END>
<BEGIN> insensibility of danger , security for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied <END>
<BEGIN> jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy <END>
<BEGIN> together . but enough of this . you alluded to something else . you <END>
<BEGIN> mentioned _ two _ instances . i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat <END>
<BEGIN> you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and <END>
<BEGIN> saying your opinion of him is sunk . we must not be so ready to fancy <END>
<BEGIN> ourselves intentionally injured . we must not expect a lively young man <END>
<BEGIN> to be always so guarded and circumspect . it is very often nothing but <END>
<BEGIN> our own vanity that deceives us . women fancy admiration means more than <END>
<BEGIN> it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and men take care that they <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea <END>
<BEGIN> of there being so much design in the world as some persons <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am far from attributing any part of mr . bingley ' s conduct to design <END>
<BEGIN> said elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others <END>
<BEGIN> unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . thoughtlessness , <END>
<BEGIN> want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , <END>
<BEGIN> will do the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and do you impute it to either of those <END>
<BEGIN> " yes ; to the last . but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what <END>
<BEGIN> i think of persons you esteem . stop me whilst you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , in conjunction with his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i cannot believe it . why should they try to influence him ? they can <END>
<BEGIN> only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can <END>
<BEGIN> secure <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " your first position is false . they may wish many things besides his <END>
<BEGIN> happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they <END>
<BEGIN> may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great <END>
<BEGIN> connections , and <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " beyond a doubt , they _ do _ wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane ; <END>
<BEGIN> " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . they have <END>
<BEGIN> known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love <END>
<BEGIN> her better . but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely <END>
<BEGIN> they should have opposed their brother ' s . what sister would think <END>
<BEGIN> herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very <END>
<BEGIN> objectionable ? if they believed him attached to me , they would not try <END>
<BEGIN> to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . by supposing such an <END>
<BEGIN> affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most <END>
<BEGIN> unhappy . do not distress me by the idea . i am not ashamed of having been <END>
<BEGIN> mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of <END>
<BEGIN> what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . let me take it <END>
<BEGIN> in the best light , in the light in which it may be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr . bingley ' s <END>
<BEGIN> name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no <END>
<BEGIN> more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account <END>
<BEGIN> for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it <END>
<BEGIN> with less perplexity . her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what <END>
<BEGIN> she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely <END>
<BEGIN> the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw <END>
<BEGIN> her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at <END>
<BEGIN> the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . mrs . bennet ' s best <END>
<BEGIN> comfort was , that mr . bingley must be down again in the summer . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet treated the matter differently . " so , lizzy said he one day , <END>
<BEGIN> " your sister is crossed in love i find . i congratulate her . next to <END>
<BEGIN> being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . <END>
<BEGIN> it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among <END>
<BEGIN> her companions . when is your turn to come ? you will hardly bear to be <END>
<BEGIN> long outdone by jane . now is your time . here are officers enough at <END>
<BEGIN> meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . let wickham <END>
<BEGIN> be _ your _ man . he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . we must not <END>
<BEGIN> all expect jane ' s good <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " true said mr . bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of <END>
<BEGIN> that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always <END>
<BEGIN> make the most of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham ' s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , <END>
<BEGIN> which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn <END>
<BEGIN> family . they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now <END>
<BEGIN> added that of general unreserve . the whole of what elizabeth had already <END>
<BEGIN> heard , his claims on mr . darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , <END>
<BEGIN> was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was <END>
<BEGIN> pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr . darcy before they <END>
<BEGIN> had known any thing of the matter . <END>
<BEGIN> miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <END>
<BEGIN> extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of <END>
<BEGIN> hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for <END>
<BEGIN> allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy was condemned as the worst of men . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter ii . <END>
<BEGIN> after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of <END>
<BEGIN> saturday . the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his <END>
<BEGIN> side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason <END>
<BEGIN> to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day <END>
<BEGIN> would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . he took leave <END>
<BEGIN> of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished <END>
<BEGIN> his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father <END>
<BEGIN> another letter of thanks . <END>
<BEGIN> on the following monday , mrs . bennet had the pleasure of receiving her <END>
<BEGIN> brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn . mr . gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly <END>
<BEGIN> superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . the netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by <END>
<BEGIN> trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well <END>
<BEGIN> bred and agreeable . mrs . gardiner , who was several years younger than <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet and mrs . philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant <END>
<BEGIN> woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces . between the <END>
<BEGIN> two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular <END>
<BEGIN> regard . they had frequently been staying with her in town . <END>
<BEGIN> the first part of mrs . gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to <END>
<BEGIN> distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . when this was <END>
<BEGIN> done , she had a less active part to play . it became her turn to listen . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . they <END>
<BEGIN> had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister . two of her <END>
<BEGIN> girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing <END>
<BEGIN> in it . <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not blame jane she continued , " for jane would have got mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley , if she could . but , lizzy ! oh , sister ! it is very hard to think <END>
<BEGIN> that she might have been mr . collins ' s wife by this time , had not it <END>
<BEGIN> been for her own perverseness . he made her an offer in this very room , <END>
<BEGIN> and she refused him . the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have <END>
<BEGIN> a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as <END>
<BEGIN> much entailed as ever . the lucases are very artful people indeed , <END>
<BEGIN> sister . they are all for what they can get . i am sorry to say it of <END>
<BEGIN> them , but so it is . it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted <END>
<BEGIN> so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves <END>
<BEGIN> before anybody else . however , your coming just at this time is the <END>
<BEGIN> greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of <END>
<BEGIN> long <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in <END>
<BEGIN> the course of jane and elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her <END>
<BEGIN> sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the <END>
<BEGIN> conversation . <END>
<BEGIN> when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . " it <END>
<BEGIN> seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she . " i am <END>
<BEGIN> sorry it went off . but these things happen so often ! a young man , such <END>
<BEGIN> as you describe mr . bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl <END>
<BEGIN> for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets <END>
<BEGIN> her , that these sort of inconstancies are very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth , " but it will not <END>
<BEGIN> do for _ us we do not suffer by _ accident it does not often happen <END>
<BEGIN> that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of <END>
<BEGIN> independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in <END>
<BEGIN> love with only a few days <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so <END>
<BEGIN> doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . it is as <END>
<BEGIN> often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , <END>
<BEGIN> as to a real , strong attachment . pray , how _ violent was _ mr . bingley ' s <END>
<BEGIN> love <END>
<BEGIN> " i never saw a more promising inclination . he was growing quite <END>
<BEGIN> inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . every time <END>
<BEGIN> they met , it was more decided and remarkable . at his own ball he <END>
<BEGIN> offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i <END>
<BEGIN> spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . could there be <END>
<BEGIN> finer symptoms ? is not general incivility the very essence of love <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt . poor <END>
<BEGIN> jane ! i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get <END>
<BEGIN> over it immediately . it had better have happened to _ you lizzy ; you <END>
<BEGIN> would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . but do you think she <END>
<BEGIN> would be prevailed on to go back with us ? change of scene might be of <END>
<BEGIN> service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded <END>
<BEGIN> of her sister ' s ready acquiescence . <END>
<BEGIN> " i hope added mrs . gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to <END>
<BEGIN> this young man will influence her . we live in so different a part of <END>
<BEGIN> town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go <END>
<BEGIN> out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , <END>
<BEGIN> unless he really comes to see <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his <END>
<BEGIN> friend , and mr . darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a <END>
<BEGIN> part of london ! my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? mr . darcy may <END>
<BEGIN> perhaps have _ heard _ of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would <END>
<BEGIN> hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its <END>
<BEGIN> impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr . bingley <END>
<BEGIN> never stirs without <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " so much the better . i hope they will not meet at all . but does not jane <END>
<BEGIN> correspond with the sister ? _ she _ will not be able to help <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " she will drop the acquaintance <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this <END>
<BEGIN> point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being <END>
<BEGIN> withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which <END>
<BEGIN> convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely <END>
<BEGIN> hopeless . it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that <END>
<BEGIN> his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends <END>
<BEGIN> successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s <END>
<BEGIN> attractions . <END>
<BEGIN> miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the <END>
<BEGIN> bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she <END>
<BEGIN> hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , <END>
<BEGIN> she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of <END>
<BEGIN> seeing him . <END>
<BEGIN> the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , <END>
<BEGIN> the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its <END>
<BEGIN> engagement . mrs . bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment <END>
<BEGIN> of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family <END>
<BEGIN> dinner . when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always <END>
<BEGIN> made part of it , of which officers mr . wickham was sure to be one ; and <END>
<BEGIN> on these occasions , mrs . gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s <END>
<BEGIN> warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . without supposing <END>
<BEGIN> them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference <END>
<BEGIN> of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she <END>
<BEGIN> resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left <END>
<BEGIN> hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such <END>
<BEGIN> an attachment . <END>
<BEGIN> to mrs . gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , <END>
<BEGIN> unconnected with his general powers . about ten or a dozen years ago , <END>
<BEGIN> before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part <END>
<BEGIN> of derbyshire , to which he belonged . they had , therefore , many <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since <END>
<BEGIN> the death of darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power <END>
<BEGIN> to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had <END>
<BEGIN> been in the way of procuring . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr . darcy by <END>
<BEGIN> character perfectly well . here consequently was an inexhaustible subject <END>
<BEGIN> of discourse . in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the <END>
<BEGIN> minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her <END>
<BEGIN> tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <END>
<BEGIN> delighting both him and herself . on being made acquainted with the <END>
<BEGIN> present mr . darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of <END>
<BEGIN> that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree <END>
<BEGIN> with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard <END>
<BEGIN> mr . fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured <END>
<BEGIN> boy . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter iii . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on <END>
<BEGIN> the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after <END>
<BEGIN> honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : <END>
<BEGIN> " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you <END>
<BEGIN> are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking <END>
<BEGIN> openly . seriously , i would have you be on your guard . do not involve <END>
<BEGIN> yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of <END>
<BEGIN> fortune would make so very imprudent . i have nothing to say against <END>
<BEGIN> _ him he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he <END>
<BEGIN> ought to have , i should think you could not do better . but as it is you <END>
<BEGIN> must not let your fancy run away with you . you have sense , and we all <END>
<BEGIN> expect you to use it . your father would depend on _ your _ resolution and <END>
<BEGIN> good conduct , i am sure . you must not disappoint your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear aunt , this is being serious <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " well , then , you need not be under any alarm . i will take care of <END>
<BEGIN> myself , and of mr . wickham too . he shall not be in love with me , if i <END>
<BEGIN> can prevent <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " elizabeth , you are not serious <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i beg your pardon . i will try again . at present i am not in love with <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham ; no , i certainly am not . but he is , beyond all comparison , <END>
<BEGIN> the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to <END>
<BEGIN> me i believe it will be better that he should not . i see the imprudence <END>
<BEGIN> of <URL> _ that _ abominable mr . darcy my father ' s opinion of me does <END>
<BEGIN> me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it . my <END>
<BEGIN> father , however , is partial to mr . wickham . in short , my dear aunt , i <END>
<BEGIN> should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but <END>
<BEGIN> since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are <END>
<BEGIN> seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into <END>
<BEGIN> engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many <END>
<BEGIN> of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it <END>
<BEGIN> would be wisdom to resist ? all that i can promise you , therefore , is not <END>
<BEGIN> to be in a hurry . i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first <END>
<BEGIN> object . when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing . in short , <END>
<BEGIN> i will do my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very <END>
<BEGIN> often . at least , you should not _ remind _ your mother of inviting <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " as i did the other day said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very <END>
<BEGIN> true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _ that but do not imagine <END>
<BEGIN> that he is always here so often . it is on your account that he has been <END>
<BEGIN> so frequently invited this week . you know my mother ' s ideas as to the <END>
<BEGIN> necessity of constant company for her friends . but really , and upon my <END>
<BEGIN> honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you <END>
<BEGIN> are <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for <END>
<BEGIN> the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice <END>
<BEGIN> being given on such a point , without being resented . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted <END>
<BEGIN> by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , <END>
<BEGIN> his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs . bennet . his marriage was <END>
<BEGIN> now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think <END>
<BEGIN> it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that <END>
<BEGIN> she wished _ they might be <URL> thursday was to be the wedding day , <END>
<BEGIN> and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose <END>
<BEGIN> to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and <END>
<BEGIN> reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her <END>
<BEGIN> out of the room . as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , <END>
<BEGIN> " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> that _ you certainly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and i have another favour to ask . will you come and see me <END>
<BEGIN> " we shall often meet , i hope , in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am not likely to leave kent for some time . promise me , therefore , to <END>
<BEGIN> come to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the <END>
<BEGIN> visit . <END>
<BEGIN> " my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte , " and <END>
<BEGIN> i hope you will consent to be of the party . indeed , eliza , you will be <END>
<BEGIN> as welcome to me as either of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from <END>
<BEGIN> the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the <END>
<BEGIN> subject as usual . elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their <END>
<BEGIN> correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it <END>
<BEGIN> should be equally unreserved was impossible . elizabeth could never <END>
<BEGIN> address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , <END>
<BEGIN> and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the <END>
<BEGIN> sake of what had been , rather than what was . charlotte ' s first letters <END>
<BEGIN> were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be <END>
<BEGIN> curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would <END>
<BEGIN> like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to <END>
<BEGIN> be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte <END>
<BEGIN> expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . she <END>
<BEGIN> wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing <END>
<BEGIN> which she could not praise . the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and <END>
<BEGIN> roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most <END>
<BEGIN> friendly and obliging . it was mr . collins ' s picture of hunsford and <END>
<BEGIN> rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait <END>
<BEGIN> for her own visit there , to know the rest . <END>
<BEGIN> jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their <END>
<BEGIN> safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it <END>
<BEGIN> would be in her power to say something of the bingleys . <END>
<BEGIN> her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience <END>
<BEGIN> generally is . jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or <END>
<BEGIN> hearing from caroline . she accounted for it , however , by supposing that <END>
<BEGIN> her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been <END>
<BEGIN> lost . <END>
<BEGIN> " my aunt she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the <END>
<BEGIN> town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley . <END>
<BEGIN> " i did not think caroline in spirits were her words , " but she was very <END>
<BEGIN> glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming <END>
<BEGIN> to london . i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . <END>
<BEGIN> i enquired after their brother , of course . he was well , but so much <END>
<BEGIN> engaged with mr . darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . i found that <END>
<BEGIN> miss darcy was expected to dinner . i wish i could see her . my visit was <END>
<BEGIN> not long , as caroline and mrs . hurst were going out . i dare say i shall <END>
<BEGIN> soon see them <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth shook her head over this letter . it convinced her , that <END>
<BEGIN> accident only could discover to mr . bingley her sister ' s being in town . <END>
<BEGIN> four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him . she endeavoured to <END>
<BEGIN> persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be <END>
<BEGIN> blind to miss bingley ' s inattention . after waiting at home every morning <END>
<BEGIN> for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the <END>
<BEGIN> visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , <END>
<BEGIN> the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no <END>
<BEGIN> longer . the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will <END>
<BEGIN> prove what she felt . <END>
<BEGIN> " my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in <END>
<BEGIN> her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have <END>
<BEGIN> been entirely deceived in miss bingley ' s regard for me . but , my <END>
<BEGIN> dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me <END>
<BEGIN> obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour <END>
<BEGIN> was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . i do not at <END>
<BEGIN> all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but <END>
<BEGIN> if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should <END>
<BEGIN> be deceived again . caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; <END>
<BEGIN> and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time . when <END>
<BEGIN> she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; <END>
<BEGIN> she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said <END>
<BEGIN> not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so <END>
<BEGIN> altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . i pity , though i <END>
<BEGIN> cannot help blaming her . she was very wrong in singling me out as <END>
<BEGIN> she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on <END>
<BEGIN> her side . but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been <END>
<BEGIN> acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her <END>
<BEGIN> brother is the cause of it . i need not explain myself farther ; and <END>
<BEGIN> though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she <END>
<BEGIN> feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <END>
<BEGIN> deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may <END>
<BEGIN> feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . i cannot but wonder , <END>
<BEGIN> however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at <END>
<BEGIN> all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . he knows of my <END>
<BEGIN> being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and <END>
<BEGIN> yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to <END>
<BEGIN> persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy . i cannot <END>
<BEGIN> understand it . if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should <END>
<BEGIN> be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of <END>
<BEGIN> duplicity in all this . but i will endeavour to banish every painful <END>
<BEGIN> thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , <END>
<BEGIN> and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . let me hear <END>
<BEGIN> from you very soon . miss bingley said something of his never <END>
<BEGIN> returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not <END>
<BEGIN> with any certainty . we had better not mention it . i am extremely <END>
<BEGIN> glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at <END>
<BEGIN> hunsford . pray go to see them , with sir william and maria . i am <END>
<BEGIN> sure you will be very comfortable there . <END>

<BEGIN> this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she <END>
<BEGIN> considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . <END>
<BEGIN> all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . she would not <END>
<BEGIN> even wish for any renewal of his attentions . his character sunk on every <END>
<BEGIN> review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible <END>
<BEGIN> advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly <END>
<BEGIN> regret what he had thrown away . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise <END>
<BEGIN> concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had <END>
<BEGIN> such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to <END>
<BEGIN> herself . his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , <END>
<BEGIN> he was the admirer of some one else . elizabeth was watchful enough to <END>
<BEGIN> see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . <END>
<BEGIN> her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied <END>
<BEGIN> with believing that _ she _ would have been his only choice , had fortune <END>
<BEGIN> permitted it . the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most <END>
<BEGIN> remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself <END>
<BEGIN> agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than <END>
<BEGIN> in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . <END>
<BEGIN> nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to <END>
<BEGIN> suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was <END>
<BEGIN> ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very <END>
<BEGIN> sincerely wish him happy . <END>
<BEGIN> all this was acknowledged to mrs . gardiner ; and after relating the <END>
<BEGIN> circumstances , she thus went on i am now convinced , my dear aunt , <END>
<BEGIN> that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that <END>
<BEGIN> pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , <END>
<BEGIN> and wish him all manner of evil . but my feelings are not only cordial <END>
<BEGIN> towards _ him they are even impartial towards miss king . i cannot find <END>
<BEGIN> out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think <END>
<BEGIN> her a very good sort of girl . there can be no love in all this . my <END>
<BEGIN> watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more <END>
<BEGIN> interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love <END>
<BEGIN> with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance . <END>
<BEGIN> importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . kitty and lydia take <END>
<BEGIN> his defection much more to heart than i do . they are young in the ways <END>
<BEGIN> of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that <END>
<BEGIN> handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> chapter iv . <END>
<BEGIN> with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise <END>
<BEGIN> diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and <END>
<BEGIN> sometimes cold , did january and february pass away . march was to take <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth to hunsford . she had not at first thought very seriously of <END>
<BEGIN> going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , <END>
<BEGIN> and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure <END>
<BEGIN> as well as greater certainty . absence had increased her desire of seeing <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr . collins . there was <END>
<BEGIN> novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <END>
<BEGIN> uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change <END>
<BEGIN> was not unwelcome for its own sake . the journey would moreover give her <END>
<BEGIN> a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have <END>
<BEGIN> been very sorry for any delay . every thing , however , went on smoothly , <END>
<BEGIN> and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch . she was <END>
<BEGIN> to accompany sir william and his second daughter . the improvement of <END>
<BEGIN> spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became <END>
<BEGIN> perfect as plan could be . <END>
<BEGIN> the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , <END>
<BEGIN> and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he <END>
<BEGIN> told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter . <END>
<BEGIN> the farewell between herself and mr . wickham was perfectly friendly ; on <END>
<BEGIN> his side even more . his present pursuit could not make him forget that <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the <END>
<BEGIN> first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner <END>
<BEGIN> of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what <END>
<BEGIN> she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their <END>
<BEGIN> opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , <END>
<BEGIN> there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her <END>
<BEGIN> to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , <END>
<BEGIN> that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the <END>
<BEGIN> amiable and pleasing . <END>
<BEGIN> her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think <END>
<BEGIN> him less agreeable . sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good <END>
<BEGIN> humoured girl , but as empty headed as himself , had nothing to say that <END>
<BEGIN> could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight <END>
<BEGIN> as the rattle of the chaise . elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had <END>
<BEGIN> known sir william ' s too long . he could tell her nothing new of the <END>
<BEGIN> wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn <END>
<BEGIN> out like his information . <END>
<BEGIN> it was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early <END>
<BEGIN> as to be in gracechurch street by noon . as they drove to mr . gardiner ' s <END>
<BEGIN> door , jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when <END>
<BEGIN> they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and <END>
<BEGIN> lovely as ever . on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , <END>
<BEGIN> whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to <END>
<BEGIN> wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her <END>
<BEGIN> for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . all was joy and <END>
<BEGIN> kindness . the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and <END>
<BEGIN> shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . their first subject was her <END>
<BEGIN> sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to <END>
<BEGIN> her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her <END>
<BEGIN> spirits , there were periods of dejection . it was reasonable , however , to <END>
<BEGIN> hope , that they would not continue long . mrs . gardiner gave her the <END>
<BEGIN> particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and <END>
<BEGIN> repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and <END>
<BEGIN> herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and <END>
<BEGIN> complimented her on bearing it so well . <END>
<BEGIN> " but , my dear elizabeth she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ? i <END>
<BEGIN> should be sorry to think our friend <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , <END>
<BEGIN> between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? where does discretion end , <END>

<BEGIN> " no why should he ? if it was not allowable for him to gain _ my _ <END>
<BEGIN> affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for <END>

<BEGIN> poor <END>

<BEGIN> " we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> gardiner , " but perhaps to the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her <END>
<BEGIN> acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . " my dear , dear <END>

<BEGIN> fresh life and vigour . adieu to disappointment and spleen . what are men <END>
<BEGIN> to rocks and mountains ? oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! and <END>
<BEGIN> when we _ do _ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without <END>
<BEGIN> being able to give one accurate idea of any thing . we _ will _ know where <END>
<BEGIN> we have gone we _ will _ recollect what we have seen . lakes , mountains , <END>
<BEGIN> and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when <END>

<BEGIN> chapter v . <END>
<BEGIN> every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had <END>
<BEGIN> seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , <END>
<BEGIN> and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . <END>
<BEGIN> when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in <END>
<BEGIN> search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . <END>
<BEGIN> the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side . elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . <END>
<BEGIN> at length the parsonage was discernible . the garden sloping to the road , <END>
<BEGIN> the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every <END>
<BEGIN> thing declared they were arriving . mr . collins and charlotte appeared at <END>
<BEGIN> the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a <END>
<BEGIN> short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole <END>
<BEGIN> party . in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the <END>
<BEGIN> sight of each other . mrs . collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when <END>
<BEGIN> she found herself so affectionately received . she saw instantly that her <END>
<BEGIN> cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility <END>
<BEGIN> was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate <END>
<BEGIN> to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . they were then , <END>
<BEGIN> with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , <END>
<BEGIN> taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he <END>
<BEGIN> welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble <END>
<BEGIN> abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help <END>
<BEGIN> fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect <END>
<BEGIN> and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if <END>
<BEGIN> wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . but though <END>
<BEGIN> every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him <END>
<BEGIN> by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend <END>
<BEGIN> that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . when mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , <END>
<BEGIN> which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte . once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte wisely did not hear . after sitting long enough to admire every <END>
<BEGIN> article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to <END>
<BEGIN> give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large <END>
<BEGIN> and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . <END>
<BEGIN> to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked <END>
<BEGIN> of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as <END>
<BEGIN> much as possible . here , leading the way through every walk and cross <END>
<BEGIN> walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he <END>
<BEGIN> asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left <END>
<BEGIN> beauty entirely behind . he could number the fields in every direction , <END>
<BEGIN> and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . but <END>
<BEGIN> of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom <END>
<BEGIN> could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , <END>
<BEGIN> afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly <END>
<BEGIN> opposite the front of his house . it was a handsome modern building , well <END>
<BEGIN> situated on rising ground . <END>
<BEGIN> from his garden , mr . collins would have led them round his two meadows , <END>
<BEGIN> but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white <END>
<BEGIN> frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte <END>
<BEGIN> took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , <END>
<BEGIN> probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s <END>
<BEGIN> help . it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every <END>
<BEGIN> thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of <END>
<BEGIN> which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit . when mr . collins could be <END>
<BEGIN> forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often <END>
<BEGIN> forgotten . <END>
<BEGIN> she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country . it <END>
<BEGIN> was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr . collins joining <END>
<BEGIN> in , observed , <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine <END>
<BEGIN> de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will <END>
<BEGIN> be delighted with her . she is all affability and condescension , and i <END>
<BEGIN> doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when <END>
<BEGIN> service is over . i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will <END>
<BEGIN> include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she <END>
<BEGIN> honours us during your stay here . her behaviour to my dear charlotte is <END>
<BEGIN> charming . we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to <END>
<BEGIN> walk home . her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us . i <END>
<BEGIN> _ should _ say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed added <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte , " and a most attentive <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say . she is the sort of <END>
<BEGIN> woman whom one cannot regard with too much <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and <END>
<BEGIN> telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , <END>
<BEGIN> and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it <END>
<BEGIN> was all done very well . she had also to anticipate how her visit would <END>
<BEGIN> pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious <END>
<BEGIN> interruptions of mr . collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with <END>
<BEGIN> rosings . a lively imagination soon settled it all . <END>
<BEGIN> about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready <END>
<BEGIN> for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in <END>
<BEGIN> confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up <END>
<BEGIN> stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . she opened the <END>
<BEGIN> door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with <END>
<BEGIN> agitation , cried out , <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , my dear eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining room , for <END>
<BEGIN> there is such a sight to be seen ! i will not tell you what it is . make <END>
<BEGIN> haste , and come down this <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , <END>
<BEGIN> and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest <END>
<BEGIN> of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the <END>
<BEGIN> garden gate . <END>
<BEGIN> " and is this all cried elizabeth . " i expected at least that the pigs <END>
<BEGIN> were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her <END>
<BEGIN> daughter <END>
<BEGIN> " la ! my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine . the old lady is mrs . jenkinson , who lives with them . the <END>
<BEGIN> other is miss de bourgh . only look at her . she is quite a little <END>
<BEGIN> creature . who would have thought she could be so thin and small <END>
<BEGIN> " she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind . <END>
<BEGIN> why does she not come in <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! charlotte says , she hardly ever does . it is the greatest of favours <END>
<BEGIN> when miss de bourgh comes <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i like her appearance said elizabeth , struck with other ideas . " she <END>
<BEGIN> looks sickly and <URL> she will do for him very well . she will <END>
<BEGIN> make him a very proper <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in <END>
<BEGIN> conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high <END>
<BEGIN> diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the <END>
<BEGIN> greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh <END>
<BEGIN> looked that way . <END>
<BEGIN> at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and <END>
<BEGIN> the others returned into the house . mr . collins no sooner saw the two <END>
<BEGIN> girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked <END>
<BEGIN> to dine at rosings the next day . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter vi . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . <END>
<BEGIN> the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering <END>
<BEGIN> visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his <END>
<BEGIN> wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of <END>
<BEGIN> doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . <END>
<BEGIN> " i confess said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by <END>
<BEGIN> her ladyship ' s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at <END>
<BEGIN> rosings . i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it <END>
<BEGIN> would happen . but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who <END>
<BEGIN> could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there <END>
<BEGIN> ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after <END>
<BEGIN> your arrival <END>
<BEGIN> " i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william , <END>
<BEGIN> " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which <END>
<BEGIN> my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . about the court , such <END>
<BEGIN> instances of elegant breeding are not <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but <END>
<BEGIN> their visit to rosings . mr . collins was carefully instructing them in <END>
<BEGIN> what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many <END>
<BEGIN> servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them . <END>
<BEGIN> when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which <END>
<BEGIN> becomes herself and daughter . i would advise you merely to put on <END>
<BEGIN> whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion <END>
<BEGIN> for any thing more . lady catherine will not think the worse of you for <END>
<BEGIN> being simply dressed . she likes to have the distinction of rank <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different <END>
<BEGIN> doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much <END>
<BEGIN> objected to be kept waiting for her <URL> formidable accounts of <END>
<BEGIN> her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , <END>
<BEGIN> who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her <END>
<BEGIN> introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had <END>
<BEGIN> done to his presentation at st . james ' s . <END>
<BEGIN> as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile <END>
<BEGIN> across the <URL> park has its beauty and its prospects ; and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such <END>
<BEGIN> raptures as mr . collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but <END>
<BEGIN> slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the <END>
<BEGIN> house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally <END>
<BEGIN> cost sir lewis de bourgh . <END>
<BEGIN> when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ' s alarm was every <END>
<BEGIN> moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> courage did not fail her . she had heard nothing of <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or <END>
<BEGIN> miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she <END>
<BEGIN> thought she could witness without trepidation . <END>
<BEGIN> from the entrance hall , of which mr . collins pointed out , with a <END>
<BEGIN> rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed <END>
<BEGIN> the servants through an anti chamber , to the room where lady catherine , <END>
<BEGIN> her daughter , and mrs . jenkinson were <URL> ladyship , with great <END>
<BEGIN> condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs . collins had settled it <END>
<BEGIN> with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was <END>
<BEGIN> performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks <END>
<BEGIN> which he would have thought necessary . <END>
<BEGIN> in spite of having been at st . james ' s , sir william was so completely <END>
<BEGIN> awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage <END>
<BEGIN> enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; <END>
<BEGIN> and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge <END>
<BEGIN> of her chair , not knowing which way to look . elizabeth found herself <END>
<BEGIN> quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> catherine was a tall , large woman , with <END>
<BEGIN> strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome . her air <END>
<BEGIN> was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to <END>
<BEGIN> make her visitors forget their inferior rank . she was not rendered <END>
<BEGIN> formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so <END>
<BEGIN> authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr . <END>
<BEGIN> wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the <END>
<BEGIN> day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had <END>
<BEGIN> represented . <END>
<BEGIN> when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment <END>
<BEGIN> she soon found some resemblance of mr . darcy , she turned her eyes on the <END>
<BEGIN> daughter , she could almost have joined in maria ' s astonishment , at her <END>
<BEGIN> being so thin , and so small . there was neither in figure nor face , any <END>
<BEGIN> likeness between the ladies . miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her <END>
<BEGIN> features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very <END>
<BEGIN> little , except in a low voice , to mrs . jenkinson , in whose appearance <END>
<BEGIN> there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening <END>
<BEGIN> to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before <END>
<BEGIN> her eyes . <END>
<BEGIN> after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , <END>
<BEGIN> to admire the view , mr . collins attending them to point out its <END>
<BEGIN> beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much <END>
<BEGIN> better worth looking at in the summer . <END>
<BEGIN> the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , <END>
<BEGIN> and all the articles of plate which mr . collins had promised ; and , as he <END>
<BEGIN> had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by <END>
<BEGIN> her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish <END>
<BEGIN> nothing <URL> carved , and ate , and praised with delighted <END>
<BEGIN> alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir <END>
<BEGIN> william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law <END>
<BEGIN> said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear . <END>
<BEGIN> but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and <END>
<BEGIN> gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved <END>
<BEGIN> a novelty to them . the party did not supply much conversation . elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated <END>
<BEGIN> between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in <END>
<BEGIN> listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all <END>
<BEGIN> dinner time . mrs . jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little <END>
<BEGIN> miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she <END>
<BEGIN> were indisposed . maria thought speaking out of the question , and the <END>
<BEGIN> gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . <END>
<BEGIN> when the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be <END>
<BEGIN> done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any <END>
<BEGIN> intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every <END>
<BEGIN> subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have <END>
<BEGIN> her judgment controverted . she enquired into charlotte ' s domestic <END>
<BEGIN> concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , <END>
<BEGIN> as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be <END>
<BEGIN> regulated in so small a family as her ' s , and instructed her as to the <END>
<BEGIN> care of her cows and her poultry . elizabeth found that nothing was <END>
<BEGIN> beneath this great lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an <END>
<BEGIN> occasion of dictating to others . in the intervals of her discourse with <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew <END>
<BEGIN> the least , and who she observed to mrs . collins , was a very genteel , <END>
<BEGIN> pretty kind of girl . she asked her at different times , how many sisters <END>
<BEGIN> she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of <END>
<BEGIN> them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they <END>
<BEGIN> had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her <END>
<BEGIN> mother ' s maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her <END>
<BEGIN> questions , but answered them very <URL> catherine then <END>
<BEGIN> observed , <END>
<BEGIN> " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr . collins , i think . for your <END>
<BEGIN> sake turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no <END>
<BEGIN> occasion for entailing estates from the female <URL> was not thought <END>
<BEGIN> necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s <URL> you play and sing , miss <END>

<BEGIN> " what , none of you <END>

<BEGIN> without a governess i never heard of such a thing . your mother must <END>

<BEGIN> elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not <END>
<BEGIN> been the case . <END>
<BEGIN> " then , who taught you ? who attended to you ? without a governess you must <END>
<BEGIN> have been <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as <END>

<BEGIN> idle , certainly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had <END>
<BEGIN> known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage <END>

<BEGIN> it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who <END>

<BEGIN> delighted with her . mrs . collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ' s <END>

<BEGIN> " upon my word said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very <END>
<BEGIN> decidedly for so young a <URL> what is your age <END>
<BEGIN> " with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling , " your <END>
<BEGIN> ladyship can hardly expect me to own <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; <END>
<BEGIN> and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever <END>
<BEGIN> dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . <END>
<BEGIN> " you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure therefore you need not <END>
<BEGIN> conceal your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am not one and <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables <END>
<BEGIN> were placed . lady catherine , sir william , and mr . and mrs . collins sat <END>
<BEGIN> down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the <END>
<BEGIN> two girls had the honour of assisting mrs . jenkinson to make up her <END>
<BEGIN> party . their table was superlatively stupid . scarcely a syllable was <END>
<BEGIN> uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs . jenkinson <END>
<BEGIN> expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or <END>
<BEGIN> having too much or too little light . a great deal more passed at the <END>
<BEGIN> other table . lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes <END>
<BEGIN> of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . mr . collins <END>
<BEGIN> was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her <END>
<BEGIN> for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . <END>
<BEGIN> sir william did not say much . he was storing his memory with anecdotes <END>
<BEGIN> and noble names . <END>
<BEGIN> when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , <END>
<BEGIN> the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs . collins , <END>
<BEGIN> gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . the party then gathered <END>
<BEGIN> round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were <END>
<BEGIN> to have on the morrow . from these instructions they were summoned by the <END>
<BEGIN> arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed . as <END>
<BEGIN> soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her <END>
<BEGIN> cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , <END>
<BEGIN> for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was . but <END>
<BEGIN> her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means <END>
<BEGIN> satisfy mr . collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ' s <END>
<BEGIN> praise into his own hands . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter vii . <END>
<BEGIN> sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough <END>
<BEGIN> to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of <END>
<BEGIN> her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met <END>
<BEGIN> with . while sir william was with them , mr . collins devoted his mornings <END>
<BEGIN> to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he <END>
<BEGIN> went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin <END>
<BEGIN> by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and <END>
<BEGIN> dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading <END>
<BEGIN> and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which <END>
<BEGIN> fronted the road . the room in which the ladies sat was backwards . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer <END>
<BEGIN> the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a <END>
<BEGIN> pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent <END>
<BEGIN> reason for what she did , for mr . collins would undoubtedly have been <END>
<BEGIN> much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and <END>
<BEGIN> she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement . <END>
<BEGIN> from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and <END>
<BEGIN> were indebted to mr . collins for the knowledge of what carriages went <END>
<BEGIN> along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , <END>
<BEGIN> which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened <END>
<BEGIN> almost every day . she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had <END>
<BEGIN> a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever <END>
<BEGIN> prevailed on to get out . <END>
<BEGIN> very few days passed in which mr . collins did not walk to rosings , and <END>
<BEGIN> not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; <END>
<BEGIN> and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings <END>
<BEGIN> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many <END>
<BEGIN> hours . now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , <END>
<BEGIN> and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during <END>
<BEGIN> these visits . she examined into their employments , looked at their work , <END>
<BEGIN> and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement <END>
<BEGIN> of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she <END>
<BEGIN> accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding <END>
<BEGIN> out that mrs . collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the <END>
<BEGIN> commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate <END>
<BEGIN> in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be <END>
<BEGIN> quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the <END>
<BEGIN> village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold <END>
<BEGIN> them into harmony and plenty . <END>
<BEGIN> the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; <END>
<BEGIN> and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card <END>
<BEGIN> table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of <END>
<BEGIN> the first . their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of <END>
<BEGIN> the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach . this <END>
<BEGIN> however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time <END>
<BEGIN> comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she <END>
<BEGIN> had often great enjoyment out of doors . her favourite walk , and where <END>
<BEGIN> she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was <END>
<BEGIN> along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was <END>
<BEGIN> a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and <END>
<BEGIN> where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ' s curiosity . <END>
<BEGIN> in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . <END>
<BEGIN> easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an <END>
<BEGIN> addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be <END>
<BEGIN> important . elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were <END>
<BEGIN> not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would <END>
<BEGIN> furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and <END>
<BEGIN> she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him <END>
<BEGIN> were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined <END>
<BEGIN> by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest <END>
<BEGIN> satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and <END>
<BEGIN> seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by <END>
<BEGIN> miss lucas and herself . <END>
<BEGIN> his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr . collins was walking <END>
<BEGIN> the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , <END>
<BEGIN> in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow <END>
<BEGIN> as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great <END>
<BEGIN> intelligence . on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his <END>
<BEGIN> respects . there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of <END>
<BEGIN> his uncle , lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . charlotte had seen <END>
<BEGIN> them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running <END>
<BEGIN> into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , <END>
<BEGIN> " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility . mr . darcy would <END>
<BEGIN> never have come so soon to wait upon <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , <END>
<BEGIN> before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly <END>
<BEGIN> afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . colonel fitzwilliam , <END>
<BEGIN> who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and <END>
<BEGIN> address most truly the gentleman . mr . darcy looked just as he had been <END>
<BEGIN> used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual <END>
<BEGIN> reserve , to mrs . collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her <END>
<BEGIN> friend , met her with every appearance of composure . elizabeth merely <END>
<BEGIN> curtseyed to him , without saying a word . <END>
<BEGIN> colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the <END>
<BEGIN> readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but <END>
<BEGIN> his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and <END>
<BEGIN> garden to mrs . collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . <END>
<BEGIN> at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth after the health of her family . she answered him in the usual <END>
<BEGIN> way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , <END>
<BEGIN> " my eldest sister has been in town these three months . have you never <END>
<BEGIN> happened to see her there <END>
<BEGIN> she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see <END>
<BEGIN> whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the <END>
<BEGIN> bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he <END>
<BEGIN> answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet . the <END>
<BEGIN> subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went <END>
<BEGIN> away . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter viii . <END>
<BEGIN> colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , <END>
<BEGIN> and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of <END>
<BEGIN> their engagements at rosings . it was some days , however , before they <END>
<BEGIN> received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the <END>
<BEGIN> house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter day , <END>
<BEGIN> almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by <END>
<BEGIN> such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to <END>
<BEGIN> come there in the evening . for the last week they had seen very little <END>
<BEGIN> of either lady catherine or her daughter . colonel fitzwilliam had called <END>
<BEGIN> at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr . darcy they had <END>
<BEGIN> only seen at church . <END>
<BEGIN> the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined <END>
<BEGIN> the party in lady catherine ' s drawing room . her ladyship received them <END>
<BEGIN> civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so <END>
<BEGIN> acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , <END>
<BEGIN> almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , <END>
<BEGIN> much more than to any other person in the room . <END>
<BEGIN> colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a <END>
<BEGIN> welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs . collins ' s pretty friend had <END>
<BEGIN> moreover caught his fancy very much . he now seated himself by her , and <END>
<BEGIN> talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying <END>
<BEGIN> at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so <END>
<BEGIN> well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much <END>
<BEGIN> spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as <END>
<BEGIN> well as of mr . darcy . _ his _ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned <END>
<BEGIN> towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a <END>
<BEGIN> while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not <END>
<BEGIN> scruple to call out , <END>
<BEGIN> " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? what is it you are talking <END>
<BEGIN> of ? what are you telling miss bennet ? let me hear what it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " we are speaking of music , madam said he , when no longer able to avoid <END>
<BEGIN> a reply . <END>
<BEGIN> " of music ! then pray speak aloud . it is of all subjects my delight . i <END>
<BEGIN> must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . <END>
<BEGIN> there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment <END>
<BEGIN> of music than myself , or a better natural taste . if i had ever learnt , i <END>
<BEGIN> should have been a great proficient . and so would anne , if her health <END>
<BEGIN> had allowed her to apply . i am confident that she would have performed <END>
<BEGIN> delightfully . how does georgiana get on , darcy <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , <END>
<BEGIN> if she does not practise a great <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i assure you , madam he replied , " that she does not need such advice . <END>
<BEGIN> she practises very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " so much the better . it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write <END>
<BEGIN> to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . i often <END>
<BEGIN> tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , <END>
<BEGIN> without constant practice . i have told miss bennet several times , that <END>
<BEGIN> she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often <END>
<BEGIN> told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . jenkinson ' s room . she would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that <END>
<BEGIN> part of the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made <END>
<BEGIN> no answer . <END>
<BEGIN> when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having <END>
<BEGIN> promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument . he <END>
<BEGIN> drew a chair near her . lady catherine listened to half a song , and then <END>
<BEGIN> talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from <END>
<BEGIN> her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , <END>
<BEGIN> stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s <END>
<BEGIN> countenance . elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first <END>
<BEGIN> convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , <END>
<BEGIN> " you mean to frighten me , mr . darcy , by coming in all this state to hear <END>
<BEGIN> me ? but i will not be alarmed though your sister _ does _ play so well . <END>
<BEGIN> there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at <END>
<BEGIN> the will of others . my courage always rises with every attempt to <END>
<BEGIN> intimidate <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied , " because you could <END>
<BEGIN> not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i <END>
<BEGIN> have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you <END>

<BEGIN> colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of <END>
<BEGIN> me , and teach you not to believe a word i say . i am particularly unlucky <END>
<BEGIN> in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a <END>
<BEGIN> part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree <END>
<BEGIN> of credit . indeed , mr . darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention <END>
<BEGIN> all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me <END>
<BEGIN> leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , <END>

<BEGIN> the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , <END>
<BEGIN> was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? he danced <END>
<BEGIN> only four dances ! i am sorry to pain you but so it was . he danced only <END>
<BEGIN> four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , <END>
<BEGIN> more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy , you cannot deny the <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> beyond my own <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? my fingers wait your <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> addressing colonel fitzwilliam . " shall we ask him why a man of sense and <END>
<BEGIN> education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend <END>
<BEGIN> himself to strangers <END>
<BEGIN> " i can answer your question said fitzwilliam , " without applying to <END>
<BEGIN> him . it is because he will not give himself the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy , <END>

<BEGIN> darcy smiled and said , " you are perfectly right . you have employed your <END>

<BEGIN> think any thing wanting . we neither of us perform to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know <END>
<BEGIN> what they were talking of . elizabeth immediately began playing again . <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said <END>
<BEGIN> to darcy , <END>
<BEGIN> " miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and <END>
<BEGIN> could have the advantage of a london master . she has a very good notion <END>
<BEGIN> of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ' s . anne would have <END>
<BEGIN> been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his <END>
<BEGIN> cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she <END>
<BEGIN> discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss <END>
<BEGIN> de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have <END>
<BEGIN> been just as likely to marry _ her had she been his relation . <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing <END>
<BEGIN> with them many instructions on execution and taste . elizabeth received <END>
<BEGIN> them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the <END>
<BEGIN> gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was <END>
<BEGIN> ready to take them all home . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter ix . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , <END>
<BEGIN> while mrs . collins and maria were gone on business into the village , <END>
<BEGIN> when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a <END>
<BEGIN> visitor . as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her <END>
<BEGIN> half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , <END>
<BEGIN> when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr . darcy , and mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy only , entered the room . <END>
<BEGIN> he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his <END>
<BEGIN> intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to <END>
<BEGIN> be within . <END>
<BEGIN> they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , <END>
<BEGIN> seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . it was absolutely <END>
<BEGIN> necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence <END>
<BEGIN> recollecting _ when _ she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling <END>
<BEGIN> curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty <END>
<BEGIN> departure , she observed , <END>
<BEGIN> " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . darcy ! <END>
<BEGIN> it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr . bingley to see you <END>
<BEGIN> all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day <END>
<BEGIN> before . he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " perfectly so i thank <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short <END>
<BEGIN> pause , added , <END>
<BEGIN> " i think i have understood that mr . bingley has not much idea of ever <END>
<BEGIN> returning to netherfield again <END>
<BEGIN> " i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend <END>
<BEGIN> very little of his time there in future . he has many friends , and he is <END>
<BEGIN> at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we <END>
<BEGIN> might possibly get a settled family there . but perhaps mr . bingley did <END>
<BEGIN> not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as <END>
<BEGIN> for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i should not be surprised said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as <END>
<BEGIN> soon as any eligible purchase <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth made no answer . she was afraid of talking longer of his <END>
<BEGIN> friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the <END>
<BEGIN> trouble of finding a subject to him . <END>
<BEGIN> he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable <END>
<BEGIN> house . lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins first came to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her <END>
<BEGIN> kindness on a more grateful <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " mr . collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of <END>
<BEGIN> the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made <END>
<BEGIN> him happy if they had . my friend has an excellent understanding though <END>
<BEGIN> i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr . collins as the wisest <END>
<BEGIN> thing she ever did . she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <END>
<BEGIN> prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a <END>
<BEGIN> distance of her own family and <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " an easy distance do you call it ? it is nearly fifty <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and what is fifty miles of good road ? little more than half a day ' s <END>
<BEGIN> journey . yes , i call it a _ very _ easy <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ <END>
<BEGIN> of the match cried elizabeth . " i should never have said mrs . collins <END>
<BEGIN> was settled _ near _ her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire . any thing beyond <END>
<BEGIN> the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she <END>
<BEGIN> understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and <END>
<BEGIN> netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her <END>
<BEGIN> family . the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many <END>
<BEGIN> varying circumstances . where there is fortune to make the expence of <END>
<BEGIN> travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . but that is not the <END>
<BEGIN> case _ here mr . and mrs . collins have a comfortable income , but not <END>
<BEGIN> such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my <END>
<BEGIN> friend would not call herself _ near _ her family under less than _ half _ <END>
<BEGIN> the present <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , you _ cannot <END>
<BEGIN> have a right to such very strong local attachment . _ you _ cannot have <END>
<BEGIN> been always at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth looked surprised . the gentleman experienced some change of <END>
<BEGIN> feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , <END>
<BEGIN> glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , <END>
<BEGIN> " are you pleased with kent <END>
<BEGIN> a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side <END>
<BEGIN> calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte <END>
<BEGIN> and her sister , just returned from their walk . the tête à - tête surprised <END>
<BEGIN> them . mr . darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding <END>
<BEGIN> on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying <END>
<BEGIN> much to any body , went away . <END>
<BEGIN> " what can be the meaning of this said charlotte , as soon as he was <END>
<BEGIN> gone . " my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have <END>
<BEGIN> called on us in this familiar <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , <END>
<BEGIN> even to charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various <END>
<BEGIN> conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from <END>
<BEGIN> the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable <END>
<BEGIN> from the time of year . all field sports were over . within doors there <END>
<BEGIN> was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be <END>
<BEGIN> always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the <END>
<BEGIN> pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the <END>
<BEGIN> two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither <END>
<BEGIN> almost every day . they called at various times of the morning , sometimes <END>
<BEGIN> separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their <END>
<BEGIN> aunt . it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he <END>
<BEGIN> had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended <END>
<BEGIN> him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in <END>
<BEGIN> being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her <END>
<BEGIN> former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw <END>
<BEGIN> there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , <END>
<BEGIN> she believed he might have the best informed mind . <END>
<BEGIN> but why mr . darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult <END>
<BEGIN> to understand . it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there <END>
<BEGIN> ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it <END>
<BEGIN> seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to <END>
<BEGIN> propriety , not a pleasure to himself . he seldom appeared really <END>
<BEGIN> animated . mrs . collins knew not what to make of him . colonel <END>
<BEGIN> fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was <END>
<BEGIN> generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told <END>
<BEGIN> her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of <END>
<BEGIN> love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself <END>
<BEGIN> seriously to work to find it <URL> watched him whenever they were at <END>
<BEGIN> rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success . he <END>
<BEGIN> certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that <END>
<BEGIN> look was disputable . it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often <END>
<BEGIN> doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it <END>
<BEGIN> seemed nothing but absence of mind . <END>
<BEGIN> she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his <END>
<BEGIN> being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of <END>
<BEGIN> raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her <END>
<BEGIN> opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would <END>
<BEGIN> vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power . <END>
<BEGIN> in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying <END>
<BEGIN> colonel fitzwilliam . he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he <END>
<BEGIN> certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , <END>
<BEGIN> to counterbalance these advantages , mr . darcy had considerable patronage <END>
<BEGIN> in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter x . <END>
<BEGIN> more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly <END>
<BEGIN> meet mr . <URL> felt all the perverseness of the mischance that <END>
<BEGIN> should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever <END>
<BEGIN> happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a <END>
<BEGIN> favourite haunt of <URL> it could occur a second time therefore was <END>
<BEGIN> very odd yet it did , and even a third . it seemed like wilful <END>
<BEGIN> ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not <END>
<BEGIN> merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he <END>
<BEGIN> actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . he never <END>
<BEGIN> said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of <END>
<BEGIN> listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre <END>
<BEGIN> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in <END>
<BEGIN> being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr . <END>
<BEGIN> and mrs . collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her <END>
<BEGIN> not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever <END>
<BEGIN> she came into kent again she would be staying _ there _ too . his words <END>
<BEGIN> seemed to imply it . could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? <END>
<BEGIN> she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what <END>
<BEGIN> might arise in that quarter . it distressed her a little , and she was <END>
<BEGIN> quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the <END>
<BEGIN> parsonage . <END>
<BEGIN> she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane ' s last <END>
<BEGIN> letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not <END>
<BEGIN> written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . darcy , <END>
<BEGIN> she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her . putting <END>
<BEGIN> away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , <END>
<BEGIN> " i did not know before that you ever walked this <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i have been making the tour of the park he replied , " as i generally <END>
<BEGIN> do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage . are <END>
<BEGIN> you going much farther <END>
<BEGIN> " no , i should have turned in a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage <END>
<BEGIN> together . <END>
<BEGIN> " do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she . <END>
<BEGIN> " yes if darcy does not put it off again . but i am at his disposal . he <END>
<BEGIN> arranges the business just as he <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least <END>
<BEGIN> great pleasure in the power of choice . i do not know any body who seems <END>
<BEGIN> more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr . <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam . <END>
<BEGIN> " but so we all do . it is only that he has better means of having it than <END>
<BEGIN> many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . i speak <END>
<BEGIN> feelingly . a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of <END>
<BEGIN> either . now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and <END>
<BEGIN> dependence ? when have you been prevented by want of money from going <END>
<BEGIN> wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for <END>
<BEGIN> " these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have <END>
<BEGIN> experienced many hardships of that nature . but in matters of greater <END>
<BEGIN> weight , i may suffer from the want of money . younger sons cannot marry <END>
<BEGIN> where they <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in <END>
<BEGIN> my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " is this thought elizabeth , " meant for me and she coloured at the <END>
<BEGIN> idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is <END>
<BEGIN> the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ? unless the elder brother is <END>
<BEGIN> very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . to interrupt <END>
<BEGIN> a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , <END>
<BEGIN> she soon afterwards said , <END>
<BEGIN> " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of <END>
<BEGIN> having somebody at his disposal . i wonder he does not marry , to secure a <END>
<BEGIN> lasting convenience of that kind . but , perhaps his sister does as well <END>
<BEGIN> for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he <END>
<BEGIN> likes with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must <END>
<BEGIN> divide with me . i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " are you , indeed ? and pray what sort of guardians do you make ? does your <END>
<BEGIN> charge give you much trouble ? young ladies of her age , are sometimes a <END>
<BEGIN> little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she <END>
<BEGIN> may like to have her own <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner <END>
<BEGIN> in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to <END>
<BEGIN> give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other <END>
<BEGIN> got pretty near the truth . she directly replied , <END>
<BEGIN> " you need not be frightened . i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare <END>
<BEGIN> say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . she is a <END>
<BEGIN> very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs . hurst and <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley . i think i have heard you say that you know <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i know them a little . their brother is a pleasant gentleman like <END>
<BEGIN> man he is a great friend of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! yes said elizabeth drily mr . darcy is uncommonly kind to mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " care of him yes , i really believe darcy _ does _ take care of him in <END>
<BEGIN> those points where he most wants care . from something that he told me in <END>
<BEGIN> our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to <END>
<BEGIN> him . but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that <END>
<BEGIN> bingley was the person meant . it was all <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " what is it you mean <END>
<BEGIN> " it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be <END>
<BEGIN> generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , <END>
<BEGIN> it would be an unpleasant <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you may depend upon my not mentioning <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be <END>
<BEGIN> bingley . what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself <END>
<BEGIN> on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most <END>
<BEGIN> imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other <END>
<BEGIN> particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him <END>
<BEGIN> the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from <END>
<BEGIN> knowing them to have been together the whole of last <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " did mr . darcy give you his reasons for this interference <END>
<BEGIN> " i understood that there were some very strong objections against the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and what arts did he use to separate them <END>
<BEGIN> " he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling . " he <END>
<BEGIN> only told me , what i have now told <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with <END>
<BEGIN> indignation . after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she <END>
<BEGIN> was so thoughtful . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she . " your <END>
<BEGIN> cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings . why was he to be the judge <END>
<BEGIN> " you are rather disposed to call his interference officious <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not see what right mr . darcy had to decide on the propriety of <END>
<BEGIN> his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to <END>
<BEGIN> determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be <URL> " but <END>
<BEGIN> she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the <END>
<BEGIN> particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . it is not to be supposed <END>
<BEGIN> that there was much affection in the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam , " but it is <END>
<BEGIN> lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , <END>
<BEGIN> therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent <END>
<BEGIN> matters till they reached the parsonage . there , shut into her own room , <END>
<BEGIN> as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption <END>
<BEGIN> of all that she had heard . it was not to be supposed that any other <END>
<BEGIN> people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . there <END>
<BEGIN> could not exist in the world _ two _ men , over whom mr . darcy could have <END>
<BEGIN> such boundless influence . that he had been concerned in the measures <END>
<BEGIN> taken to separate mr . bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she <END>
<BEGIN> had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and <END>
<BEGIN> arrangement of them . if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , <END>
<BEGIN> _ he _ was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that <END>
<BEGIN> jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . he had ruined for a <END>
<BEGIN> while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart <END>
<BEGIN> in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have <END>
<BEGIN> inflicted . <END>
<BEGIN> " there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel <END>

<BEGIN> having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in <END>

<BEGIN> of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would <END>
<BEGIN> not allow that any objections _ there _ had material weight with mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from <END>
<BEGIN> the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want <END>
<BEGIN> of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly <END>
<BEGIN> governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of <END>
<BEGIN> retaining mr . bingley for his sister . <END>
<BEGIN> the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a <END>
<BEGIN> headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to <END>
<BEGIN> her unwillingness to see mr . darcy , it determined her not to attend her <END>
<BEGIN> cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . mrs . collins , <END>
<BEGIN> seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much <END>
<BEGIN> as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr . collins <END>

<BEGIN> when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as <END>
<BEGIN> much as possible against mr . darcy , chose for her employment the <END>
<BEGIN> examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her <END>
<BEGIN> being in kent . they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any <END>
<BEGIN> revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . <END>
<BEGIN> but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that <END>
<BEGIN> cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , <END>
<BEGIN> proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly <END>
<BEGIN> disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded . elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an <END>
<BEGIN> attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . mr . darcy ' s <END>
<BEGIN> shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <END>
<BEGIN> keener sense of her sister ' s sufferings . it was some consolation to <END>
<BEGIN> think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , <END>
<BEGIN> and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be <END>
<BEGIN> with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her <END>
<BEGIN> spirits , by all that affection could do . <END>
<BEGIN> she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that <END>
<BEGIN> his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear <END>
<BEGIN> that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not <END>
<BEGIN> mean to be unhappy about him . <END>
<BEGIN> while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the <END>
<BEGIN> door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its <END>
<BEGIN> being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in <END>
<BEGIN> the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . but <END>
<BEGIN> this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently <END>
<BEGIN> affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr . darcy walk into the <END>
<BEGIN> room . in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her <END>
<BEGIN> health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . <END>
<BEGIN> she answered him with cold civility . he sat down for a few moments , and <END>
<BEGIN> then getting up walked about the room . elizabeth was surprised , but said <END>
<BEGIN> not a word . after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an <END>
<BEGIN> agitated manner , and thus began , <END>
<BEGIN> " in vain have i struggled . it will not do . my feelings will not be <END>
<BEGIN> repressed . you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression . she stared , coloured , <END>
<BEGIN> doubted , and was silent . this he considered sufficient encouragement , <END>
<BEGIN> and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , <END>
<BEGIN> immediately followed . he spoke well , but there were feelings besides <END>
<BEGIN> those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the <END>
<BEGIN> subject of tenderness than of pride . his sense of her inferiority of <END>
<BEGIN> its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had <END>
<BEGIN> always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed <END>
<BEGIN> due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to <END>
<BEGIN> recommend his suit . <END>
<BEGIN> in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to <END>
<BEGIN> the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did <END>
<BEGIN> not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to <END>
<BEGIN> receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost <END>
<BEGIN> all compassion in anger . she tried , however , to compose herself to <END>
<BEGIN> answer him with patience , when he should have done . he concluded with <END>
<BEGIN> representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of <END>
<BEGIN> all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with <END>
<BEGIN> expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of <END>
<BEGIN> his hand . as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of <END>
<BEGIN> a favourable answer . he _ spoke _ of apprehension and anxiety , but his <END>
<BEGIN> countenance expressed real security . such a circumstance could only <END>
<BEGIN> exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her <END>
<BEGIN> cheeks , and she said , <END>
<BEGIN> " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to <END>
<BEGIN> express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <END>
<BEGIN> unequally they may be returned . it is natural that obligation should be <END>
<BEGIN> felt , and if i could _ feel _ gratitude , i would now thank you . but i <END>
<BEGIN> cannot i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly <END>
<BEGIN> bestowed it most unwillingly . i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any <END>
<BEGIN> one . it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of <END>
<BEGIN> short duration . the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the <END>
<BEGIN> acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming <END>
<BEGIN> it after this <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed <END>
<BEGIN> on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than <END>
<BEGIN> surprise . his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of <END>
<BEGIN> his mind was visible in every feature . he was struggling for the <END>
<BEGIN> appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed <END>
<BEGIN> himself to have attained it . the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings <END>
<BEGIN> dreadful . at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , <END>
<BEGIN> " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! i <END>
<BEGIN> might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _ endeavour _ at <END>
<BEGIN> civility , i am thus rejected . but it is of small <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i might as well enquire replied she , " why with so evident a design of <END>
<BEGIN> offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me <END>
<BEGIN> against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? <END>
<BEGIN> was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _ was _ uncivil ? but i have <END>
<BEGIN> other provocations . you know i have . had not my own feelings decided <END>
<BEGIN> against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been <END>
<BEGIN> favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept <END>
<BEGIN> the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the <END>
<BEGIN> happiness of a most beloved sister <END>
<BEGIN> as she pronounced these words , mr . darcy changed colour ; but the emotion <END>
<BEGIN> was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she <END>
<BEGIN> continued . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have every reason in the world to think ill of you . no motive can <END>
<BEGIN> excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _ there you dare not , <END>
<BEGIN> you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means <END>
<BEGIN> of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the <END>
<BEGIN> world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for <END>
<BEGIN> disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening <END>
<BEGIN> with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse . <END>
<BEGIN> he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . <END>
<BEGIN> " can you deny that you have done it she repeated . <END>
<BEGIN> with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying <END>
<BEGIN> that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your <END>
<BEGIN> sister , or that i rejoice in my success . towards _ him _ i have been <END>
<BEGIN> kinder than towards <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , <END>
<BEGIN> but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her . <END>
<BEGIN> " but it is not merely this affair she continued , " on which my dislike <END>
<BEGIN> is founded . long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was <END>
<BEGIN> decided . your character was unfolded in the recital which i received <END>
<BEGIN> many months ago from mr . wickham . on this subject , what can you have to <END>
<BEGIN> say ? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? <END>
<BEGIN> or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others <END>
<BEGIN> " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns said darcy in <END>
<BEGIN> a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . <END>
<BEGIN> " who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an <END>
<BEGIN> interest in him <END>
<BEGIN> " his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes <END>
<BEGIN> have been great <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy . " you have reduced <END>
<BEGIN> him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . you have <END>
<BEGIN> withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for <END>
<BEGIN> him . you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence <END>
<BEGIN> which was no less his due than his desert . you have done all this ! and <END>
<BEGIN> yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and this cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , <END>
<BEGIN> " is your opinion of me ! this is the estimation in which you hold me ! i <END>
<BEGIN> thank you for explaining it so fully . my faults , according to this <END>
<BEGIN> calculation , are heavy indeed ! but perhaps added he , stopping in his <END>
<BEGIN> walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been <END>
<BEGIN> overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the <END>
<BEGIN> scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . these <END>
<BEGIN> bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy <END>
<BEGIN> concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being <END>
<BEGIN> impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by <END>
<BEGIN> reflection , by every thing . but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . <END>
<BEGIN> nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related . they were natural and just . <END>
<BEGIN> could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? <END>
<BEGIN> to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life <END>
<BEGIN> is so decidedly beneath my own <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to <END>
<BEGIN> the utmost to speak with composure when she said , <END>
<BEGIN> " you are mistaken , mr . darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your <END>
<BEGIN> declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the <END>
<BEGIN> concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a <END>
<BEGIN> more gentleman like <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , <END>
<BEGIN> " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way <END>
<BEGIN> that would have tempted me to accept <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an <END>
<BEGIN> expression of mingled incredulity and mortification . she went on . <END>
<BEGIN> " from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest <END>
<BEGIN> belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the <END>
<BEGIN> feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of <END>
<BEGIN> disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a <END>
<BEGIN> dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the <END>
<BEGIN> last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you have said quite enough , madam . i perfectly comprehend your <END>
<BEGIN> feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . <END>
<BEGIN> forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best <END>
<BEGIN> wishes for your health and <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him <END>
<BEGIN> the next moment open the front door and quit the house . <END>
<BEGIN> the tumult of her mind was now painfully great . she knew not how to <END>
<BEGIN> support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an <END>
<BEGIN> hour . her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was <END>
<BEGIN> increased by every review of it . that she should receive an offer of <END>
<BEGIN> marriage from mr . darcy ! that he should have been in love with her for <END>
<BEGIN> so many months ! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all <END>
<BEGIN> the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her <END>
<BEGIN> sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , <END>
<BEGIN> was almost incredible ! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously <END>
<BEGIN> so strong an affection . but his pride , his abominable pride , his <END>
<BEGIN> shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his <END>
<BEGIN> unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , <END>
<BEGIN> and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr . wickham , his <END>
<BEGIN> cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the <END>
<BEGIN> pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . <END>
<BEGIN> she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xii . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations <END>
<BEGIN> which had at length closed her eyes . she could not yet recover from the <END>
<BEGIN> surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing <END>
<BEGIN> else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after <END>
<BEGIN> breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . she was proceeding <END>
<BEGIN> directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr . darcy ' s <END>
<BEGIN> sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , <END>
<BEGIN> she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road . <END>
<BEGIN> the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed <END>
<BEGIN> one of the gates into the ground . <END>
<BEGIN> after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was <END>
<BEGIN> tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and <END>
<BEGIN> look into the park . the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had <END>
<BEGIN> made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <END>
<BEGIN> verdure of the early trees . she was on the point of continuing her walk , <END>
<BEGIN> when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which <END>
<BEGIN> edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy , she was directly retreating . but the person who advanced , was now <END>
<BEGIN> near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced <END>
<BEGIN> her name . she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in <END>
<BEGIN> a voice which proved it to be mr . darcy , she moved again towards the <END>
<BEGIN> gate . he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , <END>
<BEGIN> which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i <END>
<BEGIN> have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . <END>
<BEGIN> will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then , with a <END>
<BEGIN> slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of <END>
<BEGIN> sight . <END>
<BEGIN> with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , <END>
<BEGIN> perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written <END>
<BEGIN> quite through , in a very close <URL> envelope itself was likewise <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> her way along the lane , she then began it . it was dated <END>
<BEGIN> from rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows <END>
<BEGIN> " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the <END>
<BEGIN> apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , <END>
<BEGIN> or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to <END>
<BEGIN> you . i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling <END>
<BEGIN> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , <END>
<BEGIN> cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , <END>
<BEGIN> and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been <END>
<BEGIN> spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . <END>
<BEGIN> you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your <END>
<BEGIN> attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i <END>
<BEGIN> demand it of your justice . <END>
<BEGIN> " two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal <END>
<BEGIN> magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . the first mentioned <END>
<BEGIN> was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley from your sister and the other , that i had , in <END>
<BEGIN> defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , <END>
<BEGIN> ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr . <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of <END>
<BEGIN> my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who <END>
<BEGIN> had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who <END>
<BEGIN> had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , <END>
<BEGIN> to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could <END>
<BEGIN> be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally <END>
<BEGIN> bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in <END>
<BEGIN> future secured , when the following account of my actions and their <END>
<BEGIN> motives has been <URL> in the explanation of them which is <END>
<BEGIN> due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which <END>
<BEGIN> may be offensive to your ' s , i can only say that i am <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with <END>
<BEGIN> others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other <END>
<BEGIN> young woman in the <URL> it was not till the evening of the <END>
<BEGIN> dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a <END>
<BEGIN> serious <URL> had often seen him in love <URL> that <END>
<BEGIN> ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made <END>
<BEGIN> acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that <END>
<BEGIN> bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general <END>
<BEGIN> expectation of their marriage . he spoke of it as a certain event , <END>
<BEGIN> of which the time alone could be undecided . from that moment i <END>
<BEGIN> observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and i could then <END>
<BEGIN> perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had <END>
<BEGIN> ever witnessed in him . your sister i also <URL> look and <END>
<BEGIN> manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any <END>
<BEGIN> symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the <END>
<BEGIN> evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> _ you _ have not been mistaken here , _ i _ must have <END>
<BEGIN> been in an error . your superior knowledge of your sister must make <END>
<BEGIN> the latter <URL> it be so , if i have been misled by such <END>
<BEGIN> error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been <END>
<BEGIN> unreasonable . but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity <END>
<BEGIN> of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given <END>
<BEGIN> the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her <END>
<BEGIN> temper , her heart was not likely to be easily <URL> i was <END>
<BEGIN> desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will <END>
<BEGIN> venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually <END>
<BEGIN> influenced by my hopes or <URL> did not believe her to be <END>
<BEGIN> indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial <END>
<BEGIN> conviction , as truly as i wished it in <URL> objections to <END>
<BEGIN> the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged <END>
<BEGIN> to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my <END>
<BEGIN> own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to <END>
<BEGIN> my friend as to <URL> there were other causes of <END>
<BEGIN> repugnance causes which , though still existing , and existing to <END>
<BEGIN> an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to <END>
<BEGIN> forget , because they were not immediately before <URL> causes <END>
<BEGIN> must be stated , though <URL> situation of your mother ' s <END>
<BEGIN> family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that <END>
<BEGIN> total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed <END>
<BEGIN> by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by <END>
<BEGIN> your <URL> <URL> pains me to offend you . but amidst <END>
<BEGIN> your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your <END>
<BEGIN> displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you <END>
<BEGIN> consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to <END>
<BEGIN> avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally <END>
<BEGIN> bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to <END>
<BEGIN> the sense and disposition of <URL> will only say farther , that <END>
<BEGIN> from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was <END>
<BEGIN> confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me <END>
<BEGIN> before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> left netherfield for london , on the day following , <END>
<BEGIN> as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> part which i acted , is now to be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <END>
<BEGIN> coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible <END>
<BEGIN> that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly <END>
<BEGIN> resolved on joining him directly in <URL> accordingly <END>
<BEGIN> went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to <END>
<BEGIN> my friend , the certain evils of such a <URL> described , and <END>
<BEGIN> enforced them <URL> however this remonstrance might have <END>
<BEGIN> staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it <END>
<BEGIN> would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been <END>
<BEGIN> seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your <END>
<BEGIN> sister ' s indifference . he had before believed her to return his <END>
<BEGIN> affection with sincere , if not with equal <URL> bingley has <END>
<BEGIN> great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment <END>
<BEGIN> than on his <URL> convince him , therefore , that he had deceived <END>
<BEGIN> himself , was no very difficult point . to persuade him against <END>
<BEGIN> returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , <END>
<BEGIN> was scarcely the work of a <URL> cannot blame myself for <END>
<BEGIN> having done thus much . there is but one part of my conduct in the <END>
<BEGIN> whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is <END>
<BEGIN> that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to <END>
<BEGIN> conceal from him your sister ' s being in town . i knew it myself , as <END>
<BEGIN> it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant <END>
<BEGIN> of <URL> they might have met without ill consequence , is <END>
<BEGIN> perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough <END>
<BEGIN> extinguished for him to see her without some <URL> this <END>
<BEGIN> concealment , this disguise , was beneath <URL> is done , however , <END>
<BEGIN> and it was done for the <URL> this subject i have nothing more <END>
<BEGIN> to say , no other apology to offer . if i have wounded your sister ' s <END>
<BEGIN> feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which <END>
<BEGIN> governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have <END>
<BEGIN> not yet learnt to condemn <URL> respect to that other , more <END>
<BEGIN> weighty accusation , of having injured mr . wickham , i can only <END>
<BEGIN> refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my <END>
<BEGIN> family . of what he has _ particularly _ accused me i am ignorant ; but <END>
<BEGIN> of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one <END>
<BEGIN> witness of undoubted veracity . mr . wickham is the son of a very <END>
<BEGIN> respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his <END>
<BEGIN> trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on <END>
<BEGIN> george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore <END>
<BEGIN> liberally bestowed . my father supported him at school , and <END>
<BEGIN> afterwards at cambridge most important assistance , as his own <END>
<BEGIN> father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have <END>
<BEGIN> been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education . my father was not <END>
<BEGIN> only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always <END>
<BEGIN> engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the <END>
<BEGIN> church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . <END>
<BEGIN> as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think <END>
<BEGIN> of him in a very different manner . the vicious propensities the <END>
<BEGIN> want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge <END>
<BEGIN> of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man <END>
<BEGIN> of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of <END>
<BEGIN> seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr . darcy could not have . <END>
<BEGIN> here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell . <END>
<BEGIN> but whatever may be the sentiments which mr . wickham has created , a <END>
<BEGIN> suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his <END>
<BEGIN> real character . it adds even another motive . my excellent father <END>
<BEGIN> died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr . wickham was to <END>
<BEGIN> the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it <END>
<BEGIN> to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his <END>
<BEGIN> profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a <END>
<BEGIN> valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became <END>
<BEGIN> vacant . there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . his own <END>
<BEGIN> father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these <END>
<BEGIN> events , mr . wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally <END>
<BEGIN> resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it <END>
<BEGIN> unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary <END>
<BEGIN> advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be <END>
<BEGIN> benefited . he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , <END>
<BEGIN> and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would <END>
<BEGIN> be a very insufficient support therein . i rather wished , than <END>
<BEGIN> believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to <END>
<BEGIN> accede to his proposal . i knew that mr . wickham ought not to be a <END>
<BEGIN> clergyman . the business was therefore soon settled . he resigned all <END>
<BEGIN> claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could <END>
<BEGIN> ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three <END>
<BEGIN> thousand pounds . all connection between us seemed now dissolved . i <END>
<BEGIN> thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his <END>
<BEGIN> society in town . in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his <END>
<BEGIN> studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all <END>
<BEGIN> restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . for <END>
<BEGIN> about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the <END>
<BEGIN> incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied <END>
<BEGIN> to me again by letter for the presentation . his circumstances , he <END>
<BEGIN> assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were <END>
<BEGIN> exceedingly bad . he had found the law a most unprofitable study , <END>
<BEGIN> and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would <END>
<BEGIN> present him to the living in question of which he trusted there <END>
<BEGIN> could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other <END>
<BEGIN> person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered <END>
<BEGIN> father ' s intentions . you will hardly blame me for refusing to <END>
<BEGIN> comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . <END>
<BEGIN> his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his <END>
<BEGIN> circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me <END>
<BEGIN> to others , as in his reproaches to myself . after this period , every <END>
<BEGIN> appearance of acquaintance was dropt . how he lived i know not . but <END>
<BEGIN> last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . i <END>
<BEGIN> must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget <END>
<BEGIN> myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce <END>
<BEGIN> me to unfold to any human being . having said thus much , i feel no <END>
<BEGIN> doubt of your secrecy . my sister , who is more than ten years my <END>
<BEGIN> junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel <END>
<BEGIN> fitzwilliam , and myself . about a year ago , she was taken from <END>
<BEGIN> school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last <END>
<BEGIN> summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; <END>
<BEGIN> and thither also went mr . wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there <END>
<BEGIN> proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by <END>
<BEGIN> her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , <END>
<BEGIN> whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his <END>
<BEGIN> kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe <END>
<BEGIN> herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . she was then but <END>
<BEGIN> fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her <END>
<BEGIN> imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to <END>
<BEGIN> herself . i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the <END>
<BEGIN> intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea <END>
<BEGIN> of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as <END>
<BEGIN> a father , acknowledged the whole to me . you may imagine what i felt <END>
<BEGIN> and how i acted . regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings <END>
<BEGIN> prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr . wickham , who left <END>
<BEGIN> the place immediately , and mrs . younge was of course removed from <END>
<BEGIN> her charge . mr . wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my <END>
<BEGIN> sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot <END>
<BEGIN> help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a <END>
<BEGIN> strong inducement . his revenge would have been complete indeed . <END>
<BEGIN> this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we <END>
<BEGIN> have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject <END>
<BEGIN> it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty <END>
<BEGIN> towards mr . wickham . i know not in what manner , under what form of <END>
<BEGIN> falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to <END>
<BEGIN> be wondered at . ignorant as you previously were of every thing <END>
<BEGIN> concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and <END>
<BEGIN> suspicion certainly not in your inclination . you may possibly <END>
<BEGIN> wonder why all this was not told you last night . but i was not then <END>
<BEGIN> master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . <END>
<BEGIN> for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more <END>
<BEGIN> particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our <END>
<BEGIN> near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of <END>
<BEGIN> the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted <END>
<BEGIN> with every particular of these transactions . if your abhorrence of <END>
<BEGIN> _ me _ should make _ my _ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented <END>
<BEGIN> by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may <END>
<BEGIN> be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find <END>
<BEGIN> some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course <END>
<BEGIN> of the morning . i will only add , god bless you . <END>

<BEGIN> chapter xiii . <END>
<BEGIN> if elizabeth , when mr . darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to <END>
<BEGIN> contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of <END>
<BEGIN> its contents . but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly <END>
<BEGIN> she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . <END>
<BEGIN> her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . with amazement did <END>
<BEGIN> she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; <END>
<BEGIN> and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to <END>
<BEGIN> give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . with a strong <END>
<BEGIN> prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of <END>
<BEGIN> what had happened at netherfield . she read , with an eagerness which <END>
<BEGIN> hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing <END>
<BEGIN> what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the <END>
<BEGIN> sense of the one before her eyes . his belief of her sister ' s <END>
<BEGIN> insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of <END>
<BEGIN> the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have <END>
<BEGIN> any wish of doing him justice . he expressed no regret for what he had <END>
<BEGIN> done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . it <END>
<BEGIN> was all pride and insolence . <END>
<BEGIN> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr . wickham , when <END>
<BEGIN> she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , <END>
<BEGIN> if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which <END>
<BEGIN> bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings <END>
<BEGIN> were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . <END>
<BEGIN> astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . she wished <END>
<BEGIN> to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false ! <END>
<BEGIN> this cannot be ! this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had <END>
<BEGIN> gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the <END>
<BEGIN> last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not <END>
<BEGIN> regard it , that she would never look in it again . <END>
<BEGIN> in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on <END>
<BEGIN> nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter <END>
<BEGIN> was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she <END>
<BEGIN> again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and <END>
<BEGIN> commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . <END>
<BEGIN> the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly <END>
<BEGIN> what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr . darcy , <END>
<BEGIN> though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his <END>
<BEGIN> own words . so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to <END>
<BEGIN> the will , the difference was great . what wickham had said of the living <END>
<BEGIN> was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was <END>
<BEGIN> impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the <END>
<BEGIN> other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did <END>
<BEGIN> not err . but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the <END>
<BEGIN> particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions <END>
<BEGIN> to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three <END>
<BEGIN> thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . she put down the <END>
<BEGIN> letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be <END>
<BEGIN> impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with <END>
<BEGIN> little success . on both sides it was only assertion . again she read on . <END>
<BEGIN> but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had <END>
<BEGIN> believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to <END>
<BEGIN> render mr . darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a <END>
<BEGIN> turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . <END>
<BEGIN> the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could <END>
<BEGIN> bring no proof of its injustice . she had never heard of him before his <END>
<BEGIN> entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the <END>
<BEGIN> persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , <END>
<BEGIN> had there renewed a slight acquaintance . of his former way of life , <END>
<BEGIN> nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself . as to <END>
<BEGIN> his real character , had information been in her power , she had never <END>
<BEGIN> felt a wish of enquiring . his countenance , voice , and manner , had <END>
<BEGIN> established him at once in the possession of every virtue . she tried to <END>
<BEGIN> recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of <END>
<BEGIN> integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those <END>
<BEGIN> casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . but no <END>
<BEGIN> such recollection befriended her . she could see him instantly before <END>
<BEGIN> her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more <END>
<BEGIN> substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and <END>
<BEGIN> the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . after <END>
<BEGIN> pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to <END>
<BEGIN> read . but , alas ! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , <END>
<BEGIN> received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel <END>
<BEGIN> fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was <END>
<BEGIN> referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam <END>
<BEGIN> himself from whom she had previously received the information of his <END>
<BEGIN> near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no <END>
<BEGIN> reason to question . at one time she had almost resolved on applying to <END>
<BEGIN> him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and <END>
<BEGIN> at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . darcy would never <END>
<BEGIN> have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his <END>
<BEGIN> cousin ' s corroboration . <END>
<BEGIN> she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation <END>
<BEGIN> between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr . philips ' s . <END>
<BEGIN> many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . she was _ now _ <END>
<BEGIN> struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and <END>
<BEGIN> wondered it had escaped her before . she saw the indelicacy of putting <END>
<BEGIN> himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions <END>
<BEGIN> with his conduct . she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear <END>
<BEGIN> of seeing mr . darcy that mr . darcy might leave the country , but that <END>
<BEGIN> _ he _ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball <END>
<BEGIN> the very next week . she remembered also , that till the netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but <END>
<BEGIN> herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where <END>
<BEGIN> discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the <END>
<BEGIN> father , would always prevent his exposing the son . <END>
<BEGIN> how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! <END>
<BEGIN> his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and <END>
<BEGIN> hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer <END>
<BEGIN> the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing . <END>
<BEGIN> his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had <END>
<BEGIN> either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying <END>
<BEGIN> his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <END>
<BEGIN> incautiously shewn . every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter <END>
<BEGIN> and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr . darcy , she could not <END>
<BEGIN> but allow that mr . bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago <END>
<BEGIN> asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as <END>
<BEGIN> were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much <END>
<BEGIN> together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing <END>
<BEGIN> that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him <END>
<BEGIN> of irreligious or immoral habits . that among his own connections he was <END>
<BEGIN> esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a <END>
<BEGIN> brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of <END>
<BEGIN> his sister as to prove him capable of _ some _ amiable feeling . that had <END>
<BEGIN> his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of <END>
<BEGIN> every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and <END>
<BEGIN> that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man <END>
<BEGIN> as mr . bingley , was incomprehensible . <END>
<BEGIN> she grew absolutely ashamed of <URL> neither darcy nor wickham <END>
<BEGIN> could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <END>
<BEGIN> prejudiced , absurd . <END>
<BEGIN> " how despicably have i acted she <URL> who have prided myself on <END>
<BEGIN> my discernment i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have <END>
<BEGIN> often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my <END>
<BEGIN> vanity , in useless or blameable <URL> humiliating is this <END>
<BEGIN> discovery yet , how just a humiliation had i been in love , i could <END>
<BEGIN> not have been more wretchedly blind . but vanity , not love , has been my <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect <END>
<BEGIN> of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted <END>
<BEGIN> prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were <END>
<BEGIN> concerned . till this moment , i never knew <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> from herself to jane from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line <END>
<BEGIN> which soon brought to her recollection that mr . darcy ' s explanation <END>
<BEGIN> _ there had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . widely <END>
<BEGIN> different was the effect of a second <URL> could she deny that <END>
<BEGIN> credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to <END>
<BEGIN> give in the other he declared himself to have been totally <END>
<BEGIN> unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment and she could not help <END>
<BEGIN> remembering what charlotte ' s opinion had always <URL> could she <END>
<BEGIN> deny the justice of his description of <URL> felt that jane ' s <END>
<BEGIN> feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a <END>
<BEGIN> constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great <END>
<BEGIN> sensibility . <END>
<BEGIN> when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were <END>
<BEGIN> mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense <END>
<BEGIN> of shame was severe . the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly <END>
<BEGIN> for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as <END>
<BEGIN> having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first <END>
<BEGIN> disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind <END>
<BEGIN> than on hers . <END>
<BEGIN> the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . it soothed , <END>
<BEGIN> but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus <END>
<BEGIN> self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that <END>
<BEGIN> jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest <END>
<BEGIN> relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt <END>
<BEGIN> by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she <END>
<BEGIN> had ever known before . <END>
<BEGIN> after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every <END>
<BEGIN> variety of thought ; re considering events , determining probabilities , <END>
<BEGIN> and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and <END>
<BEGIN> so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her <END>
<BEGIN> at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of <END>
<BEGIN> appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such <END>
<BEGIN> reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . <END>
<BEGIN> she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each <END>
<BEGIN> called during her absence ; mr . darcy , only for a few minutes to take <END>
<BEGIN> leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least <END>
<BEGIN> an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her <END>
<BEGIN> till she could be <URL> could but just _ affect _ concern in <END>
<BEGIN> missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . colonel fitzwilliam was no <END>
<BEGIN> longer an object . she could think only of her letter . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xiv . <END>
<BEGIN> the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr . collins having <END>
<BEGIN> been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was <END>
<BEGIN> able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very <END>
<BEGIN> good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the <END>
<BEGIN> melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings . to rosings he then <END>
<BEGIN> hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , <END>
<BEGIN> brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , <END>
<BEGIN> importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of <END>
<BEGIN> having them all to dine with her . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had <END>
<BEGIN> she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her <END>
<BEGIN> future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her <END>
<BEGIN> ladyship ' s indignation would have been . " what would she have said how <END>
<BEGIN> would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself . <END>
<BEGIN> their first subject was the diminution of the rosings <URL> assure <END>
<BEGIN> you , i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine ; " i believe nobody <END>
<BEGIN> feels the loss of friends so much as i do . but i am particularly <END>
<BEGIN> attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to <END>
<BEGIN> me they were excessively sorry to go ! but so they always are . the dear <END>
<BEGIN> colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy <END>
<BEGIN> seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year . his <END>
<BEGIN> attachment to rosings , certainly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which <END>
<BEGIN> were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of <END>
<BEGIN> spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that <END>
<BEGIN> she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , <END>
<BEGIN> " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you <END>
<BEGIN> may stay a little longer . mrs . collins will be very glad of your <END>
<BEGIN> company , i am <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept <URL> must be in town <END>
<BEGIN> next <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . i expected <END>
<BEGIN> you to stay two months . i told mrs . collins so before you came . there <END>
<BEGIN> can be no occasion for your going so soon . mrs . bennet could certainly <END>
<BEGIN> spare you for another <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> " oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> are never of so much consequence to a father . and if you will stay <END>
<BEGIN> another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as <END>
<BEGIN> far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as <END>
<BEGIN> dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room <END>
<BEGIN> for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i <END>
<BEGIN> should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our <END>
<BEGIN> original <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine seemed resigned . <END>
<BEGIN> " mrs . collins , you must send a servant with them . you know i always <END>
<BEGIN> speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling <END>
<BEGIN> post by themselves . it is highly improper . you must contrive to send <END>
<BEGIN> somebody . i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> women should always be properly guarded and attended , <END>
<BEGIN> according to their situation in life . when my niece georgiana went to <END>
<BEGIN> ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go <END>
<BEGIN> with <URL> darcy , the daughter of mr . darcy , of pemberley , and lady <END>

<BEGIN> the young ladies , mrs . collins . i am glad it occurred to me to mention <END>

<BEGIN> " oh your uncle he keeps a man servant , does he i am very glad you <END>
<BEGIN> have somebody who thinks of those things . where shall you change <END>
<BEGIN> horses oh ! bromley , of <URL> you mention my name at the bell , <END>
<BEGIN> you will be attended <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , <END>
<BEGIN> and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , <END>
<BEGIN> which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so <END>
<BEGIN> occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . reflection must be <END>
<BEGIN> reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it <END>
<BEGIN> as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , <END>
<BEGIN> in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant <END>
<BEGIN> recollections . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . she <END>
<BEGIN> studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at <END>
<BEGIN> times widely different . when she remembered the style of his address , <END>
<BEGIN> she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly <END>
<BEGIN> she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against <END>
<BEGIN> herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . <END>
<BEGIN> his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she <END>
<BEGIN> could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or <END>
<BEGIN> feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . in her own past <END>
<BEGIN> behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in <END>
<BEGIN> the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin . <END>
<BEGIN> they were hopeless of remedy . her father , contented with laughing at <END>
<BEGIN> them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his <END>
<BEGIN> youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right <END>
<BEGIN> herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . elizabeth had frequently <END>
<BEGIN> united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine <END>
<BEGIN> and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , <END>
<BEGIN> what chance could there be of improvement ? catherine , weak spirited , <END>
<BEGIN> irritable , and completely under lydia ' s guidance , had been always <END>
<BEGIN> affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self willed and careless , would <END>
<BEGIN> scarcely give them a hearing . they were ignorant , idle , and vain . while <END>
<BEGIN> there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while <END>
<BEGIN> meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for <END>
<BEGIN> ever . <END>
<BEGIN> anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good <END>
<BEGIN> opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost . his affection was <END>
<BEGIN> proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , <END>
<BEGIN> unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his <END>
<BEGIN> friend . how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so <END>
<BEGIN> desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for <END>
<BEGIN> happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own <END>
<BEGIN> family ! <END>
<BEGIN> when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s <END>
<BEGIN> character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had <END>
<BEGIN> seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it <END>
<BEGIN> almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . <END>
<BEGIN> their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of <END>
<BEGIN> her stay , as they had been at first . the very last evening was spent <END>
<BEGIN> there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of <END>
<BEGIN> their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , <END>
<BEGIN> and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right <END>
<BEGIN> way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the <END>
<BEGIN> work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . <END>
<BEGIN> when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them <END>
<BEGIN> a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; <END>
<BEGIN> and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her <END>
<BEGIN> hand to both . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xv . <END>
<BEGIN> on saturday morning elizabeth and mr . collins met for breakfast a few <END>
<BEGIN> minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of <END>
<BEGIN> paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . <END>
<BEGIN> " i know not , miss elizabeth said he , " whether mrs . collins has yet <END>
<BEGIN> expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very <END>
<BEGIN> certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for <END>
<BEGIN> it . the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you . we know <END>
<BEGIN> how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . our plain <END>
<BEGIN> manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we <END>
<BEGIN> see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like <END>
<BEGIN> yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , <END>

<BEGIN> your time <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . she had <END>
<BEGIN> spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make _ her _ <END>
<BEGIN> feel the obliged . mr . collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling <END>
<BEGIN> solemnity replied , <END>
<BEGIN> " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your <END>
<BEGIN> time not disagreeably . we have certainly done our best ; and most <END>
<BEGIN> fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior <END>
<BEGIN> society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of <END>
<BEGIN> varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that <END>
<BEGIN> your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . our situation <END>
<BEGIN> with regard to lady catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of <END>
<BEGIN> extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . you see on <END>
<BEGIN> what a footing we are . you see how continually we are engaged there . in <END>
<BEGIN> truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble <END>
<BEGIN> parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of <END>
<BEGIN> compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was <END>
<BEGIN> obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility <END>
<BEGIN> and truth in a few short sentences . <END>
<BEGIN> " you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into <END>
<BEGIN> hertfordshire , my dear cousin . i flatter myself at least that you will <END>
<BEGIN> be able to do so . lady catherine ' s great attentions to mrs . collins you <END>
<BEGIN> have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear <END>
<BEGIN> that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be <END>
<BEGIN> as well to be silent . only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in <END>
<BEGIN> marriage . my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of <END>
<BEGIN> thinking . there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of <END>
<BEGIN> character and ideas between us . we seem to have been designed for each <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was <END>
<BEGIN> the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed <END>
<BEGIN> and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . she was not sorry , however , to <END>
<BEGIN> have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from <END>
<BEGIN> whom they sprung . poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to <END>
<BEGIN> such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though <END>
<BEGIN> evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to <END>
<BEGIN> ask for compassion . her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her <END>
<BEGIN> poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their <END>
<BEGIN> charms . <END>
<BEGIN> at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels <END>
<BEGIN> placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . after an affectionate <END>
<BEGIN> parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning <END>
<BEGIN> her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks <END>
<BEGIN> for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his <END>
<BEGIN> compliments to mr . and mrs . gardiner , though unknown . he then handed her <END>
<BEGIN> in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when <END>
<BEGIN> he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had <END>
<BEGIN> hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings . <END>
<BEGIN> " but he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects <END>
<BEGIN> delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you <END>
<BEGIN> while you have been <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut , and <END>
<BEGIN> the carriage drove off . <END>
<BEGIN> " good gracious cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but <END>
<BEGIN> a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have <END>
<BEGIN> happened <END>
<BEGIN> " a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh . <END>
<BEGIN> " we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there <END>
<BEGIN> twice how much i shall have to tell <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and <END>
<BEGIN> within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr . gardiner ' s <END>
<BEGIN> house , where they were to remain a few days . <END>
<BEGIN> jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her <END>
<BEGIN> spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt <END>
<BEGIN> had reserved for them . but jane was to go home with her , and at <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . <END>
<BEGIN> it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn , before she told her sister of mr . darcy ' s proposals . to know <END>
<BEGIN> that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish <END>
<BEGIN> jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own <END>
<BEGIN> vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation <END>
<BEGIN> to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision <END>
<BEGIN> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; <END>
<BEGIN> and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into <END>
<BEGIN> repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister <END>
<BEGIN> farther . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xvi . <END>
<BEGIN> it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out <END>
<BEGIN> together from gracechurch street , for the town of in hertfordshire ; <END>
<BEGIN> and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr . bennet ' s carriage was <END>
<BEGIN> to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ' s <END>
<BEGIN> punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up <END>
<BEGIN> stairs . these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily <END>
<BEGIN> employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on <END>
<BEGIN> guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber . <END>
<BEGIN> after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set <END>
<BEGIN> out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , <END>
<BEGIN> " is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise <END>
<BEGIN> " and we mean to treat you all added lydia ; " but you must lend us the <END>
<BEGIN> money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out <URL> then shewing <END>
<BEGIN> her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet . i do not think it <END>
<BEGIN> is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not . i shall <END>
<BEGIN> pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect <END>
<BEGIN> unconcern , " oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and <END>
<BEGIN> when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i <END>
<BEGIN> think it will be very tolerable . besides , it will not much signify what <END>
<BEGIN> one wears this summer , after the shire have left meryton , and they <END>
<BEGIN> are going in a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " are they indeed cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . <END>
<BEGIN> " they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to <END>
<BEGIN> take us all there for the summer ! it would be such a delicious scheme , <END>
<BEGIN> and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . mamma would like to <END>
<BEGIN> go too of all things ! only think what a miserable summer else we shall <END>
<BEGIN> have <END>
<BEGIN> " yes thought elizabeth , that _ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , <END>
<BEGIN> and completely do for us at once . good heaven ! brighton , and a whole <END>
<BEGIN> campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor <END>
<BEGIN> regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " now i have got some news for you said lydia , as they sat down to <END>
<BEGIN> table . " what do you think ? it is excellent news , capital news , and about <END>
<BEGIN> a certain person that we all <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he <END>
<BEGIN> need not stay . lydia laughed , and said , <END>
<BEGIN> " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . you thought the <END>
<BEGIN> waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! i dare say he often hears worse <END>
<BEGIN> things said than i am going to say . but he is an ugly fellow ! i am glad <END>
<BEGIN> he is gone . i never saw such a long chin in my life . well , but now for <END>
<BEGIN> my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? <END>
<BEGIN> there is no danger of wickham ' s marrying mary king . there ' s for you ! she <END>
<BEGIN> is gone down to her uncle at liverpool ; gone to stay . wickham is <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and mary king is safe added elizabeth ; " safe from a connection <END>
<BEGIN> imprudent as to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " she is a great fool for going away , if she liked <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am sure there is not on _ his i will answer for it he never cared <END>
<BEGIN> three straws about her . who _ could _ about such a nasty little freckled <END>
<BEGIN> thing <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such <END>
<BEGIN> coarseness of _ expression _ herself , the coarseness of the _ sentiment _ <END>
<BEGIN> was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied <END>
<BEGIN> liberal ! <END>
<BEGIN> as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was <END>
<BEGIN> ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their <END>
<BEGIN> boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ' s and <END>
<BEGIN> lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it . <END>
<BEGIN> " how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia . " i am glad i bought my <END>
<BEGIN> bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! well , now <END>
<BEGIN> let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way <END>
<BEGIN> home . and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , <END>
<BEGIN> since you went away . have you seen any pleasant men ? have you had any <END>
<BEGIN> flirting ? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband <END>
<BEGIN> before you came back . jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare . <END>
<BEGIN> she is almost three and twenty ! lord , how ashamed i should be of not <END>
<BEGIN> being married before three and twenty ! my aunt philips wants you so to <END>
<BEGIN> get husbands , you can ' t think . she says lizzy had better have taken mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins ; but _ i _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . lord ! <END>
<BEGIN> how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would <END>
<BEGIN> chaperon you about to all the balls . dear me ! we had such a good piece <END>
<BEGIN> of fun the other day at colonel forster ' s . kitty and me were to spend <END>
<BEGIN> the day there , and mrs . forster promised to have a little dance in the <END>
<BEGIN> evening ; ( by the bye , mrs . forster and me are _ such _ friends and so <END>
<BEGIN> she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen <END>
<BEGIN> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? we <END>
<BEGIN> dressed up chamberlayne in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a <END>
<BEGIN> lady only think what fun ! not a soul knew of it , but col . and mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow <END>
<BEGIN> one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! when denny , <END>
<BEGIN> and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they <END>
<BEGIN> did not know him in the least . lord ! how i laughed ! and so did mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> forster . i thought i should have died . and _ that _ made the men suspect <END>
<BEGIN> something , and then they soon found out what was the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , <END>
<BEGIN> assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her <END>
<BEGIN> companions all the way to longbourn . elizabeth listened as little as she <END>
<BEGIN> could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ' s name . <END>
<BEGIN> their reception at home was most kind . mrs . bennet rejoiced to see jane <END>
<BEGIN> in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr . bennet <END>
<BEGIN> say voluntarily to elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> " i am glad you are come back , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the lucases <END>
<BEGIN> came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects <END>
<BEGIN> which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , <END>
<BEGIN> after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs . bennet was <END>
<BEGIN> doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present <END>
<BEGIN> fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , <END>
<BEGIN> retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice <END>
<BEGIN> rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various <END>
<BEGIN> pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! mary said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! <END>
<BEGIN> as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended <END>
<BEGIN> there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if <END>
<BEGIN> kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we <END>
<BEGIN> behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest <END>
<BEGIN> cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have <END>
<BEGIN> treated you too . and then when we came away it was such fun ! i thought <END>
<BEGIN> we never should have got into the coach . i was ready to die of laughter . <END>
<BEGIN> and then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so <END>
<BEGIN> loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off <END>
<BEGIN> to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , <END>
<BEGIN> to depreciate such pleasures . they would doubtless be congenial with <END>
<BEGIN> the generality of female minds . but i confess they would have no charms <END>
<BEGIN> for _ me i should infinitely prefer a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but of this answer lydia heard not a word . she seldom listened to any <END>
<BEGIN> body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all . <END>
<BEGIN> in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to <END>
<BEGIN> meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed <END>
<BEGIN> the scheme . it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at <END>
<BEGIN> home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . there was <END>
<BEGIN> another reason too for her opposition . she dreaded seeing wickham again , <END>
<BEGIN> and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . the comfort to _ her <END>
<BEGIN> of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . in <END>
<BEGIN> a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be <END>
<BEGIN> nothing more to plague her on his account . <END>
<BEGIN> she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton <END>
<BEGIN> scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under <END>
<BEGIN> frequent discussion between her parents . elizabeth saw directly that her <END>
<BEGIN> father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were <END>
<BEGIN> at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often <END>
<BEGIN> disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xvii . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no <END>
<BEGIN> longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular <END>
<BEGIN> in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , <END>
<BEGIN> she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy and herself . <END>
<BEGIN> miss bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly <END>
<BEGIN> partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . she was <END>
<BEGIN> sorry that mr . darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so <END>
<BEGIN> little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the <END>
<BEGIN> unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him . <END>
<BEGIN> " his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong said she ; " and certainly <END>
<BEGIN> ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has <END>
<BEGIN> other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . <END>
<BEGIN> you do not blame me , however , for refusing him <END>
<BEGIN> " blame you ! oh , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but you _ will _ know it , when i have told you what happened the very <END>
<BEGIN> next <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far <END>
<BEGIN> as they concerned george wickham . what a stroke was this for poor jane ! <END>
<BEGIN> who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that <END>
<BEGIN> so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here <END>
<BEGIN> collected in one individual . nor was darcy ' s vindication , though <END>
<BEGIN> grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . <END>
<BEGIN> most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and <END>
<BEGIN> seek to clear one , without involving the other . <END>
<BEGIN> " this will not do said elizabeth . " you never will be able to make both <END>
<BEGIN> of them good for any thing . take your choice , but you must be satisfied <END>
<BEGIN> with only one . there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just <END>
<BEGIN> enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting <END>
<BEGIN> about pretty much . for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ' s , but you shall do as you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane . <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not know when i have been more shocked said she . " wickham so <END>
<BEGIN> very bad ! it is almost past belief . and poor mr . darcy ! dear lizzy , only <END>
<BEGIN> consider what he must have suffered . such a disappointment ! and with the <END>
<BEGIN> knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of <END>
<BEGIN> his sister ! it is really too distressing . i am sure you must feel it <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so <END>
<BEGIN> full of both . i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am <END>
<BEGIN> growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . your profusion <END>
<BEGIN> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will <END>
<BEGIN> be as light as a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his <END>
<BEGIN> countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those <END>
<BEGIN> two young men . one has got all the goodness , and the other all the <END>
<BEGIN> appearance of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i never thought mr . darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you <END>
<BEGIN> used to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike <END>
<BEGIN> to him , without any reason . it is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an <END>
<BEGIN> opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . one may be continually <END>
<BEGIN> abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing <END>
<BEGIN> at a man without now and then stumbling on something <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat <END>
<BEGIN> the matter as you do <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed i could not . i was uncomfortable enough . i was very <END>
<BEGIN> uncomfortable , i may say unhappy . and with no one to speak to , of what i <END>
<BEGIN> felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and <END>
<BEGIN> vain and nonsensical as i knew i had ! oh ! how i wanted you <END>
<BEGIN> " how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions <END>
<BEGIN> in speaking of wickham to mr . darcy , for now they _ do _ appear wholly <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " certainly . but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most <END>
<BEGIN> natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging . there is <END>
<BEGIN> one point , on which i want your advice . i want to be told whether i <END>
<BEGIN> ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand <END>
<BEGIN> wickham ' s <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no <END>
<BEGIN> occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . what is your own opinion <END>
<BEGIN> " that it ought not to be attempted . mr . darcy has not authorised me to <END>
<BEGIN> make his communication public . on the contrary every particular relative <END>
<BEGIN> to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and <END>
<BEGIN> if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who <END>
<BEGIN> will believe me ? the general prejudice against mr . darcy is so violent , <END>
<BEGIN> that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to <END>
<BEGIN> attempt to place him in an amiable light . i am not equal to it . wickham <END>
<BEGIN> will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , <END>
<BEGIN> what he really is . sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we <END>
<BEGIN> may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . at present i will <END>
<BEGIN> say nothing about <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are quite right . to have his errors made public might ruin him for <END>
<BEGIN> ever . he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to <END>
<BEGIN> re establish a character . we must not make him <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation . she had <END>
<BEGIN> got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , <END>
<BEGIN> and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish <END>
<BEGIN> to talk again of either . but there was still something lurking behind , <END>
<BEGIN> of which prudence forbad the disclosure . she dared not relate the other <END>
<BEGIN> half of mr . darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she <END>
<BEGIN> had been valued by his friend . here was knowledge in which no one could <END>
<BEGIN> partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect <END>
<BEGIN> understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this <END>
<BEGIN> last incumbrance of mystery . " and then said she , " if that very <END>
<BEGIN> improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell <END>
<BEGIN> what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . the <END>
<BEGIN> liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value <END>
<BEGIN> she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real <END>
<BEGIN> state of her sister ' s spirits . jane was not happy . she still cherished a <END>
<BEGIN> very tender affection for bingley . having never even fancied herself in <END>
<BEGIN> love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from <END>
<BEGIN> her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often <END>
<BEGIN> boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to <END>
<BEGIN> every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the <END>
<BEGIN> feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those <END>
<BEGIN> regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their <END>
<BEGIN> tranquillity . <END>
<BEGIN> " well , lizzy said mrs . bennet one day , " what is your opinion _ now _ of <END>
<BEGIN> this sad business of jane ' s ? for my part , i am determined never to speak <END>
<BEGIN> of it again to anybody . i told my sister philips so the other day . but i <END>
<BEGIN> cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london . well , he is a <END>
<BEGIN> very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least <END>
<BEGIN> chance in the world of her ever getting him now . there is no talk of his <END>
<BEGIN> coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every <END>
<BEGIN> body too , who is likely to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , well ! it is just as he chooses . nobody wants him to come . though i <END>
<BEGIN> shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was <END>
<BEGIN> her , i would not have put up with it . well , my comfort is , i am sure <END>
<BEGIN> jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he <END>
<BEGIN> has <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , <END>
<BEGIN> she made no answer . <END>
<BEGIN> " well , lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the <END>
<BEGIN> collinses live very comfortable , do they ? well , well , i only hope it <END>
<BEGIN> will last . and what sort of table do they keep ? charlotte is an <END>
<BEGIN> excellent manager , i dare say . if she is half as sharp as her mother , <END>
<BEGIN> she is saving enough . there is nothing extravagant in _ their _ <END>
<BEGIN> housekeeping , i dare <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no , nothing at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " a great deal of good management , depend upon it . yes , yes . _ they _ will <END>
<BEGIN> take care not to outrun their income . _ they _ will never be distressed <END>
<BEGIN> for money . well , much good may it do them ! and so , i suppose , they often <END>
<BEGIN> talk of having longbourn when your father is dead . they look upon it <END>
<BEGIN> quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it was a subject which they could not mention before <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no . it would have been strange if they had . but i make no doubt , they <END>
<BEGIN> often talk of it between themselves . well , if they can be easy with an <END>

<BEGIN> the first week of their return was soon gone . the second began . it was <END>
<BEGIN> the last of the regiment ' s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in <END>

<BEGIN> and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . very <END>
<BEGIN> frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and <END>
<BEGIN> lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such <END>
<BEGIN> hard heartedness in any of the family . <END>
<BEGIN> " good heaven ! what is to become of us ! what are we to do would they <END>
<BEGIN> often exclaim in the bitterness of woe . " how can you be smiling so , <END>
<BEGIN> lizzy <END>
<BEGIN> their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what <END>
<BEGIN> she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years <END>
<BEGIN> ago . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am sure said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel <END>

<BEGIN> " and my aunt philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good <END>
<BEGIN> added kitty . <END>
<BEGIN> such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn house . elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense <END>
<BEGIN> of pleasure was lost in shame . she felt anew the justice of mr . darcy ' s <END>
<BEGIN> objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his <END>
<BEGIN> interference in the views of his friend . <END>
<BEGIN> but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she <END>
<BEGIN> received an invitation from mrs . forster , the wife of the colonel of the <END>
<BEGIN> regiment , to accompany her to brighton . this invaluable friend was a <END>
<BEGIN> very young woman , and very lately married . a resemblance in good humour <END>
<BEGIN> and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of <END>
<BEGIN> their _ three _ months ' acquaintance they had been intimate _ two <END>
<BEGIN> the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs . forster , <END>
<BEGIN> the delight of mrs . bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely <END>
<BEGIN> to be described . wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew <END>
<BEGIN> about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s <END>
<BEGIN> congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; <END>
<BEGIN> whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate <END>
<BEGIN> in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . <END>
<BEGIN> " i cannot see why mrs . forster should not ask _ me _ as well as lydia <END>
<BEGIN> said she , " though i am _ not _ her particular friend . i have just as much <END>
<BEGIN> right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make <END>
<BEGIN> her resigned . as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from <END>
<BEGIN> exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she <END>
<BEGIN> considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense <END>
<BEGIN> for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it <END>
<BEGIN> known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her <END>
<BEGIN> go . she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general <END>
<BEGIN> behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of <END>
<BEGIN> such a woman as mrs . forster , and the probability of her being yet more <END>
<BEGIN> imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must <END>
<BEGIN> be greater than at home . he heard her attentively , and then said , <END>
<BEGIN> " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public <END>
<BEGIN> place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little <END>
<BEGIN> expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if you were aware said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to <END>
<BEGIN> us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia ' s unguarded and <END>
<BEGIN> imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you <END>
<BEGIN> would judge differently in the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " already arisen repeated mr . bennet . " what , has she frightened away <END>
<BEGIN> some of your lovers ? poor little lizzy ! but do not be cast down . such <END>
<BEGIN> squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , <END>
<BEGIN> are not worth a regret . come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows <END>
<BEGIN> who have been kept aloof by lydia ' s <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed you are mistaken . i have no such injuries to resent . it is not <END>
<BEGIN> of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining . our <END>
<BEGIN> importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the <END>
<BEGIN> wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark <END>
<BEGIN> lydia ' s character . excuse me for i must speak plainly . if you , my dear <END>
<BEGIN> father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and <END>
<BEGIN> of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of <END>
<BEGIN> her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . her character <END>
<BEGIN> will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt <END>
<BEGIN> that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . a flirt too , in the <END>
<BEGIN> worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond <END>
<BEGIN> youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of <END>
<BEGIN> her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal <END>
<BEGIN> contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . in this danger kitty <END>
<BEGIN> is also comprehended . she will follow wherever lydia leads . vain , <END>
<BEGIN> ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! oh ! my dear father , can you <END>
<BEGIN> suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever <END>
<BEGIN> they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the <END>
<BEGIN> disgrace <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and <END>
<BEGIN> affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , <END>
<BEGIN> " do not make yourself uneasy , my love . wherever you and jane are known , <END>
<BEGIN> you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less <END>
<BEGIN> advantage for having a couple of or i may say , three very silly <END>
<BEGIN> sisters . we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to <END>
<BEGIN> brighton . let her go then . colonel forster is a sensible man , and will <END>
<BEGIN> keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an <END>
<BEGIN> object of prey to any body . at brighton she will be of less importance <END>
<BEGIN> even as a common flirt than she has been here . the officers will find <END>
<BEGIN> women better worth their notice . let us hope , therefore , that her being <END>
<BEGIN> there may teach her her own insignificance . at any rate , she cannot grow <END>
<BEGIN> many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest <END>
<BEGIN> of her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion <END>
<BEGIN> continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . it was not <END>
<BEGIN> in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them . <END>
<BEGIN> she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <END>
<BEGIN> unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her <END>
<BEGIN> disposition . <END>
<BEGIN> had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her <END>
<BEGIN> father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their <END>
<BEGIN> united volubility . in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised <END>
<BEGIN> every possibility of earthly happiness . she saw with the creative eye of <END>
<BEGIN> fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers . she <END>
<BEGIN> saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at <END>
<BEGIN> present unknown . she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents <END>
<BEGIN> stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young <END>
<BEGIN> and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she <END>
<BEGIN> saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six <END>
<BEGIN> officers at once . <END>
<BEGIN> had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and <END>
<BEGIN> such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? they could <END>
<BEGIN> have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the <END>
<BEGIN> same . lydia ' s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the <END>
<BEGIN> melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there <END>
<BEGIN> himself . <END>
<BEGIN> but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures <END>
<BEGIN> continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia ' s leaving <END>
<BEGIN> home . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was now to see mr . wickham for the last time . having been <END>
<BEGIN> frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty <END>
<BEGIN> well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . she had even <END>
<BEGIN> learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , <END>
<BEGIN> an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . in his present <END>
<BEGIN> behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , <END>
<BEGIN> for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which <END>
<BEGIN> had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after <END>
<BEGIN> what had since passed , to provoke her . she lost all concern for him in <END>
<BEGIN> finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous <END>
<BEGIN> gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the <END>
<BEGIN> reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever <END>
<BEGIN> cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified <END>
<BEGIN> and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . <END>
<BEGIN> on the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in meryton , he dined <END>
<BEGIN> with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some <END>
<BEGIN> enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she <END>
<BEGIN> mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr . darcy ' s having both spent three <END>
<BEGIN> weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . <END>
<BEGIN> he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s <END>
<BEGIN> recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen <END>
<BEGIN> him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , <END>
<BEGIN> asked her how she had liked him . her answer was warmly in his favour . <END>
<BEGIN> with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you <END>
<BEGIN> say that he was at rosings <END>
<BEGIN> " nearly three <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and you saw him frequently <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , almost every <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " his manners are very different from his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , very different . but i think mr . darcy improves on <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her . " and pray <END>
<BEGIN> may i ask but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in <END>
<BEGIN> address that he improves ? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his <END>
<BEGIN> ordinary style ? for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more <END>
<BEGIN> serious tone , " that he is improved in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , no said elizabeth . " in essentials , i believe , he is very much <END>
<BEGIN> what he ever <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to <END>
<BEGIN> rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . there was a <END>
<BEGIN> something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive <END>
<BEGIN> and anxious attention , while she added , <END>
<BEGIN> " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that <END>
<BEGIN> either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from <END>
<BEGIN> knowing him better , his disposition was better <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated <END>
<BEGIN> look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his <END>
<BEGIN> embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of <END>
<BEGIN> accents , <END>
<BEGIN> " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . darcy , will readily <END>
<BEGIN> comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume <END>
<BEGIN> even the _ appearance _ of what is right . his pride , in that direction , <END>
<BEGIN> may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter <END>
<BEGIN> him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by . i only fear that <END>
<BEGIN> the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , <END>
<BEGIN> is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and <END>
<BEGIN> judgment he stands much in awe . his fear of her , has always operated , i <END>
<BEGIN> know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his <END>
<BEGIN> wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he <END>
<BEGIN> has very much at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a <END>
<BEGIN> slight inclination of the head . she saw that he wanted to engage her on <END>
<BEGIN> the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge <END>
<BEGIN> him . the rest of the evening passed with the _ appearance on his side , <END>
<BEGIN> of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a <END>
<BEGIN> mutual desire of never meeting again . <END>
<BEGIN> when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs . forster to meryton , <END>
<BEGIN> from whence they were to set out early the next morning . the separation <END>
<BEGIN> between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . kitty was the <END>
<BEGIN> only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , <END>
<BEGIN> and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the <END>
<BEGIN> opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there <END>
<BEGIN> was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous <END>
<BEGIN> happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus <END>
<BEGIN> of her sisters were uttered without being heard . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xix . <END>
<BEGIN> had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could <END>
<BEGIN> not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic <END>
<BEGIN> comfort . her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance <END>
<BEGIN> of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a <END>
<BEGIN> woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in <END>
<BEGIN> their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . respect , <END>
<BEGIN> esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of <END>
<BEGIN> domestic happiness were overthrown . but mr . bennet was not of a <END>
<BEGIN> disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own <END>
<BEGIN> imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often <END>
<BEGIN> console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . he was fond of <END>
<BEGIN> the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal <END>
<BEGIN> enjoyments . to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as <END>
<BEGIN> her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . this is not <END>
<BEGIN> the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his <END>
<BEGIN> wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <END>
<BEGIN> philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her <END>
<BEGIN> father ' s behaviour as a husband . she had always seen it with pain ; but <END>
<BEGIN> respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of <END>
<BEGIN> herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to <END>
<BEGIN> banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation <END>
<BEGIN> and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own <END>
<BEGIN> children , was so highly reprehensible . but she had never felt so <END>
<BEGIN> strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so <END>
<BEGIN> unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils <END>
<BEGIN> arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly <END>
<BEGIN> used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , <END>
<BEGIN> even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife . <END>
<BEGIN> when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little <END>
<BEGIN> other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . their parties <END>
<BEGIN> abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and <END>
<BEGIN> sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around <END>
<BEGIN> them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty <END>
<BEGIN> might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers <END>
<BEGIN> of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition <END>
<BEGIN> greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her <END>
<BEGIN> folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering <END>
<BEGIN> place and a camp . upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been <END>
<BEGIN> sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward <END>
<BEGIN> with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the <END>
<BEGIN> satisfaction she had promised herself . it was consequently necessary to <END>
<BEGIN> name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have <END>
<BEGIN> some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by <END>
<BEGIN> again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the <END>
<BEGIN> present , and prepare for another disappointment . her tour to the lakes <END>
<BEGIN> was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation <END>
<BEGIN> for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her <END>
<BEGIN> mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in <END>
<BEGIN> the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . <END>
<BEGIN> " but it is fortunate thought she , " that i have something to wish for . <END>
<BEGIN> were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . <END>
<BEGIN> but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my <END>
<BEGIN> sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure realized . a scheme of which every part promises delight , can <END>
<BEGIN> never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by <END>
<BEGIN> the defence of some little peculiar <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely <END>
<BEGIN> to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and <END>
<BEGIN> always very short . those to her mother , contained little else , than that <END>
<BEGIN> they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers <END>
<BEGIN> had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as <END>
<BEGIN> made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which <END>
<BEGIN> she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a <END>
<BEGIN> violent hurry , as mrs . forster called her , and they were going to the <END>
<BEGIN> camp and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less <END>
<BEGIN> to be learnt for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much <END>
<BEGIN> too full of lines under the words to be made public . <END>
<BEGIN> after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good <END>
<BEGIN> humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn . everything wore <END>
<BEGIN> a happier aspect . the families who had been in town for the winter came <END>
<BEGIN> back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . mrs . bennet <END>
<BEGIN> was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june <END>
<BEGIN> kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without <END>
<BEGIN> tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by <END>
<BEGIN> the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to <END>
<BEGIN> mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious <END>
<BEGIN> arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in <END>
<BEGIN> meryton . <END>
<BEGIN> the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast <END>
<BEGIN> approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter <END>
<BEGIN> arrived from mrs . gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and <END>
<BEGIN> curtailed its extent . mr . gardiner would be prevented by business from <END>
<BEGIN> setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again <END>
<BEGIN> within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so <END>
<BEGIN> far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with <END>
<BEGIN> the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up <END>
<BEGIN> the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the <END>
<BEGIN> present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire . in that <END>
<BEGIN> county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three <END>
<BEGIN> weeks ; and to mrs . gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . the <END>
<BEGIN> town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where <END>
<BEGIN> they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of <END>
<BEGIN> her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , <END>
<BEGIN> dovedale , or the peak . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing <END>
<BEGIN> the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . but it <END>
<BEGIN> was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy ; <END>
<BEGIN> and all was soon right again . <END>
<BEGIN> with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . it was <END>
<BEGIN> impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its <END>
<BEGIN> owner . " but surely said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , <END>
<BEGIN> and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the period of expectation was now doubled . four weeks were to pass away <END>
<BEGIN> before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival . but they did pass away , and mr . and <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn . the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two <END>
<BEGIN> younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin <END>
<BEGIN> jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and <END>
<BEGIN> sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every <END>
<BEGIN> way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . <END>
<BEGIN> the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next <END>
<BEGIN> morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement . one <END>
<BEGIN> enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions ; a <END>
<BEGIN> suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear <END>
<BEGIN> inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection <END>
<BEGIN> and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were <END>
<BEGIN> disappointments abroad . <END>
<BEGIN> it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , <END>
<BEGIN> nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither <END>
<BEGIN> lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , & c . are <END>
<BEGIN> sufficiently known . a small part of derbyshire is all the present <END>
<BEGIN> concern . to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs . gardiner ' s <END>
<BEGIN> former residence , and where she had lately learned that some <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen <END>
<BEGIN> all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of <END>
<BEGIN> lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated . it <END>
<BEGIN> was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it . in <END>
<BEGIN> talking over their route the evening before , mrs . gardiner expressed an <END>
<BEGIN> inclination to see the place again . mr . gardiner declared his <END>
<BEGIN> willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . <END>
<BEGIN> " my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so <END>
<BEGIN> much said her aunt . " a place too , with which so many of your <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance are connected . wickham passed all his youth there , you <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was distressed . she felt that she had no business at <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . she <END>
<BEGIN> must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , <END>
<BEGIN> she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner abused her stupidity . " if it were merely a fine house <END>
<BEGIN> richly furnished said she , " i should not care about it myself ; but the <END>
<BEGIN> grounds are delightful . they have some of the finest woods in the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce . the <END>
<BEGIN> possibility of meeting mr . darcy , while viewing the place , instantly <END>
<BEGIN> occurred . it would be dreadful ! she blushed at the very idea ; and <END>
<BEGIN> thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run <END>
<BEGIN> such a risk . but against this , there were objections ; and she finally <END>
<BEGIN> resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as <END>
<BEGIN> to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered . <END>
<BEGIN> accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid <END>
<BEGIN> whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its <END>
<BEGIN> proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for <END>
<BEGIN> the summer . a most welcome negative followed the last question and her <END>
<BEGIN> alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of <END>
<BEGIN> curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the <END>
<BEGIN> next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and <END>
<BEGIN> with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike <END>
<BEGIN> to the scheme . <END>
<BEGIN> to pemberley , therefore , they were to go . <END>

<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired <END>
<BEGIN> every remarkable spot and point of view . they gradually ascended for <END>
<BEGIN> half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable <END>
<BEGIN> eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which <END>
<BEGIN> the road with some abruptness wound . it was a large , handsome , stone <END>
<BEGIN> building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high <END>
<BEGIN> woody hills and in front , a stream of some natural importance was <END>
<BEGIN> swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . its banks <END>
<BEGIN> were neither formal , nor falsely adorned . elizabeth was delighted . she <END>
<BEGIN> had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural <END>
<BEGIN> beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . they were <END>
<BEGIN> all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that <END>
<BEGIN> to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! <END>
<BEGIN> they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , <END>
<BEGIN> while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of <END>
<BEGIN> meeting its owner returned . she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been <END>
<BEGIN> mistaken . on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the <END>
<BEGIN> hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to <END>
<BEGIN> wonder at her being where she was . <END>
<BEGIN> the housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , elderly woman , much less <END>
<BEGIN> fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . they <END>
<BEGIN> followed her into the dining parlour . it was a large , well proportioned <END>
<BEGIN> room , handsomely fitted up . elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went <END>
<BEGIN> to a window to enjoy its prospect . the hill , crowned with wood , from <END>
<BEGIN> which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the <END>
<BEGIN> distance , was a beautiful object . every disposition of the ground was <END>
<BEGIN> good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered <END>
<BEGIN> on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace <END>
<BEGIN> it , with delight . as they passed into other rooms , these objects were <END>
<BEGIN> taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to <END>
<BEGIN> be seen . the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable <END>
<BEGIN> to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration <END>
<BEGIN> of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of <END>
<BEGIN> splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings . <END>
<BEGIN> " and of this place thought she , " i might have been mistress ! with <END>
<BEGIN> these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! instead of <END>
<BEGIN> viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and <END>
<BEGIN> welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and <URL> no recollecting <END>
<BEGIN> herself that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost <END>
<BEGIN> to me : i should not have been allowed to invite <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret . <END>
<BEGIN> she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really <END>
<BEGIN> absent , but had not courage for it . at length , however , the question was <END>
<BEGIN> asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs . reynolds <END>
<BEGIN> replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a <END>
<BEGIN> large party of <URL> how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own <END>
<BEGIN> journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! <END>
<BEGIN> her aunt now called her to look at a picture . she approached , and saw <END>
<BEGIN> the likeness of mr . wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , <END>
<BEGIN> over the mantle piece . her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . <END>
<BEGIN> the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a <END>
<BEGIN> young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been <END>
<BEGIN> brought up by him at his own <URL> is now gone into the army <END>
<BEGIN> she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not <END>
<BEGIN> return it . <END>
<BEGIN> " and that said mrs . reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , <END>
<BEGIN> " is my master and very like him . it was drawn at the same time as the <END>
<BEGIN> other about eight years <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i have heard much of your master ' s fine person said mrs . gardiner , <END>
<BEGIN> looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . but , lizzy , you can tell <END>
<BEGIN> us whether it is like or <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . reynolds ' s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this <END>
<BEGIN> intimation of her knowing her master . <END>
<BEGIN> " does that young lady know mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth coloured , and said a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma ' am <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am sure _ i _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you <END>
<BEGIN> will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . this room was my late <END>
<BEGIN> master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to <END>
<BEGIN> be then . he was very fond of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this accounted to elizabeth for mr . wickham ' s being among them . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn <END>
<BEGIN> when she was only eight years old . <END>
<BEGIN> " and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr . gardiner . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so <END>
<BEGIN> accomplished she plays and sings all day long . in the next room is a <END>
<BEGIN> new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she <END>
<BEGIN> comes here to morrow with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her <END>
<BEGIN> communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs . reynolds , either <END>
<BEGIN> from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her <END>
<BEGIN> master and his sister . <END>
<BEGIN> " is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year <END>
<BEGIN> " not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his <END>
<BEGIN> time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " except thought elizabeth , " when she goes to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if your master would marry , you might see more of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , sir ; but i do not know when _ that _ will be . i do not know who is <END>
<BEGIN> good enough for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . and mrs . gardiner smiled . elizabeth could not help saying , " it is <END>
<BEGIN> very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows <END>
<BEGIN> him replied the other . elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; <END>
<BEGIN> and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , <END>
<BEGIN> " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him <END>
<BEGIN> ever since he was four years <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her <END>
<BEGIN> ideas . that he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest <END>
<BEGIN> opinion . her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , <END>
<BEGIN> and was grateful to her uncle for saying , <END>
<BEGIN> " there are very few people of whom so much can be said . you are lucky in <END>
<BEGIN> having such a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , sir , i know i am . if i was to go through the world , i could not <END>
<BEGIN> meet with a better . but i have always observed , that they who are <END>
<BEGIN> good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he <END>
<BEGIN> was always the sweetest tempered , most generous hearted , boy in the <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth almost stared at <URL> this be mr . darcy thought she . <END>
<BEGIN> " his father was an excellent man said mrs . gardiner . <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just <END>
<BEGIN> as affable to the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> reynolds could interest her on no other point . she related the subject <END>
<BEGIN> of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the <END>
<BEGIN> furniture , in vain . mr . gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family <END>
<BEGIN> prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her <END>
<BEGIN> master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his <END>
<BEGIN> many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . <END>
<BEGIN> " he is the best landlord , and the best master said she , " that ever <END>
<BEGIN> lived . not like the wild young men now a - days , who think of nothing but <END>
<BEGIN> themselves . there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will <END>
<BEGIN> give him a good name . some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never <END>
<BEGIN> saw any thing of it . to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle <END>
<BEGIN> away like other young <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> " this fine account of him whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not <END>
<BEGIN> quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " perhaps we might be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is not very likely ; our authority was too <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very <END>
<BEGIN> pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and <END>
<BEGIN> lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but <END>
<BEGIN> just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the <END>
<BEGIN> room , when last at pemberley . <END>
<BEGIN> " he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth , as she walked towards <END>
<BEGIN> one of the windows . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . reynolds anticipated miss darcy ' s delight , when she should enter <END>
<BEGIN> the room . " and this is always the way with him she <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . there <END>
<BEGIN> is nothing he would not do for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were <END>
<BEGIN> all that remained to be shewn . in the former were many good paintings ; <END>
<BEGIN> but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already <END>
<BEGIN> visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and <END>
<BEGIN> also more intelligible . <END>
<BEGIN> in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have <END>
<BEGIN> little to fix the attention of a stranger . elizabeth walked on in quest <END>
<BEGIN> of the only face whose features would be known to her . at last it <END>
<BEGIN> arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr . darcy , with <END>
<BEGIN> such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , <END>
<BEGIN> when he looked at her . she stood several minutes before the picture in <END>
<BEGIN> earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the <END>
<BEGIN> gallery . mrs . reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his <END>
<BEGIN> father ' s life time . <END>
<BEGIN> there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle <END>
<BEGIN> sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of <END>
<BEGIN> their acquaintance . the commendation bestowed on him by mrs . reynolds <END>
<BEGIN> was of no trifling nature . what praise is more valuable than the praise <END>
<BEGIN> of an intelligent servant ? as a brother , a landlord , a master , she <END>
<BEGIN> considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship how <END>
<BEGIN> much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of <END>
<BEGIN> good or evil must be done by him ! every idea that had been brought <END>
<BEGIN> forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she <END>
<BEGIN> stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes <END>
<BEGIN> upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of <END>
<BEGIN> gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and <END>
<BEGIN> softened its impropriety of expression . <END>
<BEGIN> when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , <END>
<BEGIN> they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <END>
<BEGIN> consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . <END>
<BEGIN> as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back <END>
<BEGIN> to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was <END>
<BEGIN> conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself <END>
<BEGIN> suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . <END>
<BEGIN> they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his <END>
<BEGIN> appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . their eyes <END>
<BEGIN> instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest <END>
<BEGIN> blush . he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from <END>
<BEGIN> surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , <END>
<BEGIN> and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least <END>
<BEGIN> of perfect civility . <END>
<BEGIN> she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , <END>
<BEGIN> received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be <END>
<BEGIN> overcome . had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture <END>
<BEGIN> they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two <END>
<BEGIN> that they now saw mr . darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on <END>
<BEGIN> beholding his master , must immediately have told it . they stood a little <END>
<BEGIN> aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , <END>
<BEGIN> scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she <END>
<BEGIN> returned to his civil enquiries after her family . amazed at the <END>
<BEGIN> alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he <END>
<BEGIN> uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the <END>
<BEGIN> impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few <END>
<BEGIN> minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most <END>
<BEGIN> uncomfortable of her life . nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he <END>
<BEGIN> spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his <END>
<BEGIN> enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay <END>
<BEGIN> in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the <END>
<BEGIN> distraction of his thoughts . <END>
<BEGIN> at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few <END>
<BEGIN> moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took <END>
<BEGIN> leave . <END>
<BEGIN> the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his <END>
<BEGIN> figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own <END>
<BEGIN> feelings , followed them in silence . she was overpowered by shame and <END>
<BEGIN> vexation . her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged <END>
<BEGIN> thing in the world ! how strange must it appear to him ! in what a <END>
<BEGIN> disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! it might seem as if <END>
<BEGIN> she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! oh ! why did she come ? <END>
<BEGIN> or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? had they been <END>
<BEGIN> only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <END>
<BEGIN> discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that <END>
<BEGIN> moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . she blushed again and <END>
<BEGIN> again over the perverseness of the meeting . and his behaviour , so <END>
<BEGIN> strikingly altered what could it mean ? that he should even speak to <END>
<BEGIN> her was amazing but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her <END>
<BEGIN> family ! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , <END>
<BEGIN> never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . <END>
<BEGIN> what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing ' s park , when <END>
<BEGIN> he put his letter into her hand ! she knew not what to think , nor how to <END>
<BEGIN> account for it . <END>
<BEGIN> they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and <END>
<BEGIN> every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer <END>
<BEGIN> reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time <END>
<BEGIN> before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered <END>
<BEGIN> mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed <END>
<BEGIN> to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she <END>
<BEGIN> distinguished no part of the scene . her thoughts were all fixed on that <END>
<BEGIN> one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr . darcy then <END>
<BEGIN> was . she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in <END>
<BEGIN> what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , <END>
<BEGIN> she was still dear to him . perhaps he had been civil , only because he <END>
<BEGIN> felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _ that _ in his voice , which was <END>
<BEGIN> not like ease . whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing <END>
<BEGIN> her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with <END>
<BEGIN> composure . <END>
<BEGIN> at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind <END>
<BEGIN> roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . <END>
<BEGIN> they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , <END>
<BEGIN> ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening <END>
<BEGIN> of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of <END>
<BEGIN> the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <END>
<BEGIN> overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . mr . gardiner <END>
<BEGIN> expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be <END>
<BEGIN> beyond a walk . with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten <END>
<BEGIN> miles round . it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed <END>
<BEGIN> circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among <END>
<BEGIN> hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts . <END>
<BEGIN> they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of <END>
<BEGIN> the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and <END>
<BEGIN> the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the <END>
<BEGIN> stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered <END>
<BEGIN> it . elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed <END>
<BEGIN> the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . gardiner , <END>
<BEGIN> who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of <END>
<BEGIN> returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . her niece was , <END>
<BEGIN> therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house <END>
<BEGIN> on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their <END>
<BEGIN> progress was slow , for mr . gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the <END>
<BEGIN> taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the <END>
<BEGIN> occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man <END>
<BEGIN> about them , that he advanced but little . whilst wandering on in this <END>
<BEGIN> slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was <END>
<BEGIN> quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> approaching them , and at no great distance . the walk being here less <END>
<BEGIN> sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they <END>
<BEGIN> met . elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an <END>
<BEGIN> interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with <END>
<BEGIN> calmness , if he really intended to meet them . for a few moments , indeed , <END>
<BEGIN> she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . this idea <END>
<BEGIN> lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the <END>
<BEGIN> turning past , he was immediately before them . with a glance she saw , <END>
<BEGIN> that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his <END>
<BEGIN> politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; <END>
<BEGIN> but she had not got beyond the words " delightful and " charming when <END>
<BEGIN> some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed . her colour <END>
<BEGIN> changed , and she said no more . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked <END>
<BEGIN> her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . <END>
<BEGIN> this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and <END>
<BEGIN> she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had <END>
<BEGIN> revolted , in his offer to herself . " what will be his surprise thought <END>
<BEGIN> she , " when he knows who they are ! he takes them now for people of <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their <END>
<BEGIN> relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore <END>
<BEGIN> it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he <END>
<BEGIN> could from such disgraceful companions . that he was _ surprised _ by the <END>
<BEGIN> connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so <END>
<BEGIN> far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into <END>
<BEGIN> conversation with mr . gardiner . elizabeth could not but be pleased , <END>
<BEGIN> could not but triumph . it was consoling , that he should know she had <END>
<BEGIN> some relations for whom there was no need to blush . she listened most <END>
<BEGIN> attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every <END>
<BEGIN> expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , <END>
<BEGIN> his taste , or his good manners . <END>
<BEGIN> the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he <END>
<BEGIN> chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same <END>
<BEGIN> time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of <END>
<BEGIN> the stream where there was usually most sport . mrs . gardiner , who was <END>
<BEGIN> walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her <END>
<BEGIN> wonder . elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the <END>
<BEGIN> compliment must be all for herself . her astonishment , however , was <END>
<BEGIN> extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ? from <END>
<BEGIN> what can it proceed ? it cannot be for _ me it cannot be for _ my _ sake <END>
<BEGIN> that his manners are thus softened . my reproofs at hunsford could not <END>
<BEGIN> work such a change as this . it is impossible that he should still love <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two <END>
<BEGIN> gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the <END>
<BEGIN> brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious <END>
<BEGIN> water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . it originated in <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred <END>
<BEGIN> her husband ' s . mr . darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on <END>
<BEGIN> together . after a short silence , the lady first spoke . she wished him to <END>
<BEGIN> know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the <END>
<BEGIN> place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been <END>
<BEGIN> very unexpected for your housekeeper she added , " informed us that <END>
<BEGIN> you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we <END>
<BEGIN> left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in <END>
<BEGIN> the <URL> he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that <END>
<BEGIN> business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours <END>
<BEGIN> before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . " they <END>
<BEGIN> will join me early to morrow he continued , " and among them are some <END>
<BEGIN> who will claim an acquaintance with you mr . bingley and his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . her thoughts were instantly <END>
<BEGIN> driven back to the time when mr . bingley ' s name had been last mentioned <END>
<BEGIN> between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _ his _ mind was <END>
<BEGIN> not very differently engaged . <END>
<BEGIN> " there is also one other person in the party he continued after a <END>
<BEGIN> pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow <END>
<BEGIN> me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance <END>
<BEGIN> during your stay at lambton <END>
<BEGIN> the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great <END>
<BEGIN> for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . she immediately felt <END>
<BEGIN> that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , <END>
<BEGIN> must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was <END>
<BEGIN> satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made <END>
<BEGIN> him think really ill of her . <END>
<BEGIN> they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and <END>
<BEGIN> pleased . his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of <END>
<BEGIN> the highest kind . they soon outstripped the others , and when they had <END>
<BEGIN> reached the carriage , mr . and mrs . gardiner were half a quarter of a <END>
<BEGIN> mile behind . <END>
<BEGIN> he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not <END>
<BEGIN> tired , and they stood together on the lawn . at such a time , much might <END>
<BEGIN> have been said , and silence was very awkward . she wanted to talk , but <END>
<BEGIN> there seemed an embargo on every subject . at last she recollected that <END>
<BEGIN> she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with <END>
<BEGIN> great perseverance . yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience <END>
<BEGIN> and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à - tête was over . on <END>
<BEGIN> mr . and mrs . gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the <END>
<BEGIN> house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted <END>
<BEGIN> on each side with the utmost politeness . mr . darcy handed the ladies <END>
<BEGIN> into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking <END>
<BEGIN> slowly towards the house . <END>
<BEGIN> the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them <END>
<BEGIN> pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . <END>
<BEGIN> " he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming said her uncle . <END>
<BEGIN> " there _ is _ something a little stately in him to be sure replied her <END>
<BEGIN> aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . i can now <END>
<BEGIN> say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , <END>
<BEGIN> _ i _ have seen nothing of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . it was more <END>
<BEGIN> than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such <END>
<BEGIN> attention . his acquaintance with elizabeth was very <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " to be sure , lizzy said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham ; <END>
<BEGIN> or rather he has not wickham ' s countenance , for his features are <END>
<BEGIN> perfectly good . but how came you to tell us that he was so <END>
<BEGIN> disagreeable <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked <END>
<BEGIN> him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never <END>
<BEGIN> seen him so pleasant as this morning . <END>
<BEGIN> " but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied <END>
<BEGIN> her uncle . " your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him <END>
<BEGIN> at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and <END>
<BEGIN> warn me off his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said <END>
<BEGIN> nothing . <END>
<BEGIN> " from what we have seen of him continued mrs . gardiner , " i really <END>
<BEGIN> should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by <END>
<BEGIN> any body , as he has done by poor wickham . he has not an ill natured <END>
<BEGIN> look . on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when <END>
<BEGIN> he speaks . and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that <END>
<BEGIN> would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . but to be sure , <END>
<BEGIN> the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming <END>
<BEGIN> character ! i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . but he is a <END>
<BEGIN> liberal master , i suppose , and _ that _ in the eye of a servant <END>
<BEGIN> comprehends every <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of <END>
<BEGIN> his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as <END>
<BEGIN> guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his <END>
<BEGIN> relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different <END>
<BEGIN> construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor <END>
<BEGIN> wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . in <END>
<BEGIN> confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary <END>
<BEGIN> transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming <END>
<BEGIN> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now <END>
<BEGIN> approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to <END>
<BEGIN> the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out <END>
<BEGIN> to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of <END>
<BEGIN> any thing else . fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had <END>
<BEGIN> no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an <END>
<BEGIN> intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance . <END>
<BEGIN> the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing <END>
<BEGIN> but think , and think with wonder , of mr . darcy ' s civility , and above <END>
<BEGIN> all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter ii . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had settled it that mr . darcy would bring his sister to visit <END>
<BEGIN> her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently <END>
<BEGIN> resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . <END>
<BEGIN> but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own <END>
<BEGIN> arrival at lambton , these visitors came . they had been walking about the <END>
<BEGIN> place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn <END>
<BEGIN> to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a <END>
<BEGIN> carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a <END>
<BEGIN> curricle , driving up the street . elizabeth immediately recognising the <END>
<BEGIN> livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise <END>
<BEGIN> to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she <END>
<BEGIN> expected . her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment <END>
<BEGIN> of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many <END>
<BEGIN> of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on <END>
<BEGIN> the business . nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt <END>
<BEGIN> that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such <END>
<BEGIN> a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . while these <END>
<BEGIN> newly born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing . she was quite amazed <END>
<BEGIN> at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she <END>
<BEGIN> dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in <END>
<BEGIN> her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally <END>
<BEGIN> suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . <END>
<BEGIN> she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked <END>
<BEGIN> up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks <END>
<BEGIN> of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . <END>
<BEGIN> miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction <END>
<BEGIN> took place . with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . since her <END>
<BEGIN> being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; <END>
<BEGIN> but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was <END>
<BEGIN> only exceedingly shy . she found it difficult to obtain even a word from <END>
<BEGIN> her beyond a monosyllable . <END>
<BEGIN> miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though <END>
<BEGIN> little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance <END>
<BEGIN> womanly and graceful . she was less handsome than her brother , but there <END>
<BEGIN> was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> unassuming and gentle . elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as <END>
<BEGIN> acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr . darcy had been , was much <END>
<BEGIN> relieved by discerning such different feelings . <END>
<BEGIN> they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was <END>
<BEGIN> also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her <END>
<BEGIN> satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step <END>
<BEGIN> was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . all <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she <END>
<BEGIN> still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the <END>
<BEGIN> unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her <END>
<BEGIN> again . he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , <END>
<BEGIN> and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever <END>
<BEGIN> done . <END>
<BEGIN> to mr . and mrs . gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage <END>
<BEGIN> than to herself . they had long wished to see him . the whole party before <END>
<BEGIN> them , indeed , excited a lively attention . the suspicions which had just <END>
<BEGIN> arisen of mr . darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards <END>
<BEGIN> each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from <END>
<BEGIN> those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what <END>
<BEGIN> it was to love . of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in <END>
<BEGIN> doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was <END>
<BEGIN> evident enough . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . she wanted to ascertain the <END>
<BEGIN> feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to <END>
<BEGIN> make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she <END>
<BEGIN> feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she <END>
<BEGIN> endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour . bingley <END>
<BEGIN> was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased . <END>
<BEGIN> in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! <END>
<BEGIN> how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a <END>
<BEGIN> like manner . sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on <END>
<BEGIN> former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that <END>
<BEGIN> as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . but , though <END>
<BEGIN> this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour <END>
<BEGIN> to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane . no look appeared <END>
<BEGIN> on either side that spoke particular regard . nothing occurred between <END>
<BEGIN> them that could justify the hopes of his sister . on this point she was <END>
<BEGIN> soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they <END>
<BEGIN> parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of <END>
<BEGIN> jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that <END>
<BEGIN> might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . he observed to her , at a <END>
<BEGIN> moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had <END>
<BEGIN> something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had <END>
<BEGIN> the pleasure of seeing her and , before she could reply , he added , " it <END>
<BEGIN> is above eight months . we have not met since the 26th of november , when <END>
<BEGIN> we were all dancing together at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards <END>
<BEGIN> took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , <END>
<BEGIN> whether _ all _ her sisters were at longbourn . there was not much in the <END>
<BEGIN> question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner <END>
<BEGIN> which gave them meaning . <END>
<BEGIN> it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr . darcy himself ; but , <END>
<BEGIN> whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general <END>
<BEGIN> complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far <END>
<BEGIN> removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that <END>
<BEGIN> the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however <END>
<BEGIN> temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . when <END>
<BEGIN> she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion <END>
<BEGIN> of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a <END>
<BEGIN> disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the <END>
<BEGIN> very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last <END>
<BEGIN> lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so <END>
<BEGIN> great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly <END>
<BEGIN> restrain her astonishment from being visible . never , even in the company <END>
<BEGIN> of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at <END>
<BEGIN> rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from <END>
<BEGIN> self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could <END>
<BEGIN> result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the <END>
<BEGIN> acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw <END>
<BEGIN> down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and <END>
<BEGIN> rosings . <END>
<BEGIN> their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose <END>
<BEGIN> to depart , mr . darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing <END>
<BEGIN> their wish of seeing mr . and mrs . gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner <END>
<BEGIN> at pemberley , before they left the country . miss darcy , though with a <END>
<BEGIN> diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , <END>
<BEGIN> readily obeyed . mrs . gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing <END>
<BEGIN> how _ she whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its <END>
<BEGIN> acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head . presuming , however , <END>
<BEGIN> that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than <END>
<BEGIN> any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of <END>
<BEGIN> society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for <END>
<BEGIN> her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to <END>
<BEGIN> make after all their hertfordshire friends . elizabeth , construing all <END>
<BEGIN> this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on <END>
<BEGIN> this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors <END>
<BEGIN> left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some <END>
<BEGIN> satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been <END>
<BEGIN> little . eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her <END>
<BEGIN> uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their <END>
<BEGIN> favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress . <END>
<BEGIN> but she had no reason to fear mr . and mrs . gardiner ' s curiosity ; it was <END>
<BEGIN> not their wish to force her communication . it was evident that she was <END>
<BEGIN> much better acquainted with mr . darcy than they had before any idea of ; <END>
<BEGIN> it was evident that he was very much in love with her . they saw much to <END>
<BEGIN> interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . <END>
<BEGIN> of mr . darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far <END>
<BEGIN> as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . they could <END>
<BEGIN> not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character <END>
<BEGIN> from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference <END>
<BEGIN> to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , <END>
<BEGIN> would not have recognised it for mr . darcy . there was now an interest , <END>
<BEGIN> however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , <END>
<BEGIN> that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four <END>
<BEGIN> years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be <END>
<BEGIN> hastily rejected . neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of <END>
<BEGIN> their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . they <END>
<BEGIN> had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if <END>
<BEGIN> not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small <END>
<BEGIN> market town , where the family did not visit . it was acknowledged , <END>
<BEGIN> however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . <END>
<BEGIN> with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held <END>
<BEGIN> there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the <END>
<BEGIN> son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known <END>
<BEGIN> fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind <END>
<BEGIN> him , which mr . darcy afterwards discharged . <END>
<BEGIN> as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than <END>
<BEGIN> the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not <END>
<BEGIN> long enough to determine her feelings towards _ one _ in that mansion ; and <END>
<BEGIN> she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . she <END>
<BEGIN> certainly did not hate him . no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she <END>
<BEGIN> had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , <END>
<BEGIN> that could be so called . the respect created by the conviction of his <END>
<BEGIN> valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some <END>
<BEGIN> time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened <END>
<BEGIN> into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his <END>
<BEGIN> favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , <END>
<BEGIN> which yesterday had produced . but above all , above respect and esteem , <END>
<BEGIN> there was a motive within her of good will which could not be <END>
<BEGIN> overlooked . it was <URL> not merely for having once <END>
<BEGIN> loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the <END>
<BEGIN> petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the <END>
<BEGIN> unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . he who , she had been <END>
<BEGIN> persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this <END>
<BEGIN> accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without <END>
<BEGIN> any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where <END>
<BEGIN> their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion <END>
<BEGIN> of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . such a <END>
<BEGIN> change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but <END>
<BEGIN> gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such <END>
<BEGIN> its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means <END>
<BEGIN> unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . she respected , she <END>
<BEGIN> esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his <END>
<BEGIN> welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to <END>
<BEGIN> depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both <END>
<BEGIN> that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still <END>
<BEGIN> possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . <END>
<BEGIN> it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that <END>
<BEGIN> such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very <END>
<BEGIN> day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late <END>
<BEGIN> breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by <END>
<BEGIN> some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it <END>
<BEGIN> would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following <END>
<BEGIN> morning . they were , therefore , to <URL> was pleased , though , <END>
<BEGIN> when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . gardiner left them soon after breakfast . the fishing scheme had been <END>
<BEGIN> renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting <END>
<BEGIN> some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter iii . <END>
<BEGIN> convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislike of her had <END>
<BEGIN> originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome <END>
<BEGIN> her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with <END>
<BEGIN> how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be <END>
<BEGIN> renewed . <END>
<BEGIN> on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , <END>
<BEGIN> whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . its windows <END>
<BEGIN> opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody <END>
<BEGIN> hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts <END>
<BEGIN> which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . <END>
<BEGIN> in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there <END>
<BEGIN> with mrs . hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in <END>
<BEGIN> london . georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil ; but attended with <END>
<BEGIN> all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the <END>
<BEGIN> fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves <END>
<BEGIN> inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved . mrs . gardiner and <END>
<BEGIN> her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . <END>
<BEGIN> by mrs . hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and <END>
<BEGIN> on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , <END>
<BEGIN> succeeded for a few moments . it was first broken by mrs . annesley , a <END>
<BEGIN> genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind <END>
<BEGIN> of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the <END>
<BEGIN> others ; and between her and mrs . gardiner , with occasional help from <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . miss darcy looked as if she <END>
<BEGIN> wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a <END>
<BEGIN> short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , <END>
<BEGIN> and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without <END>
<BEGIN> calling her attention . this observation would not have prevented her <END>
<BEGIN> from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an <END>
<BEGIN> inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity <END>
<BEGIN> of saying much . her own thoughts were employing her . she expected every <END>
<BEGIN> moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . she wished , she <END>
<BEGIN> feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether <END>
<BEGIN> she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine . after <END>
<BEGIN> sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss <END>
<BEGIN> bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold <END>
<BEGIN> enquiry after the health of her family . she answered with equal <END>
<BEGIN> indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . <END>
<BEGIN> the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the <END>
<BEGIN> entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the <END>
<BEGIN> finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a <END>
<BEGIN> significant look and smile from mrs . annesley to miss darcy had been <END>
<BEGIN> given , to remind her of her post . there was now employment for the whole <END>
<BEGIN> party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the <END>
<BEGIN> beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected <END>
<BEGIN> them round the table . <END>
<BEGIN> while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether <END>
<BEGIN> she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr . darcy , by the <END>
<BEGIN> feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but <END>
<BEGIN> a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to <END>
<BEGIN> regret that he came . <END>
<BEGIN> he had been some time with mr . gardiner , who , with two or three other <END>
<BEGIN> gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him <END>
<BEGIN> only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to <END>
<BEGIN> georgiana that morning . no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely <END>
<BEGIN> resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more <END>
<BEGIN> necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she <END>
<BEGIN> saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , <END>
<BEGIN> and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour <END>
<BEGIN> when he first came into the room . in no countenance was attentive <END>
<BEGIN> curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the <END>
<BEGIN> smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its <END>
<BEGIN> objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions <END>
<BEGIN> to mr . darcy were by no means over . miss darcy , on her brother ' s <END>
<BEGIN> entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he <END>
<BEGIN> was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , <END>
<BEGIN> as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . miss <END>
<BEGIN> bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the <END>
<BEGIN> first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , <END>
<BEGIN> " pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ? <END>
<BEGIN> they must be a great loss to _ your _ <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name ; but elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the <END>
<BEGIN> various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; <END>
<BEGIN> but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she <END>
<BEGIN> presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . while <END>
<BEGIN> she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened <END>
<BEGIN> complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with <END>
<BEGIN> confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . had miss bingley known what <END>
<BEGIN> pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <END>
<BEGIN> refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed <END>
<BEGIN> her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in <END>
<BEGIN> darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and <END>
<BEGIN> absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that <END>
<BEGIN> corps . not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated <END>
<BEGIN> elopement . to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was <END>
<BEGIN> possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley ' s connections her <END>
<BEGIN> brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish <END>
<BEGIN> which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming <END>
<BEGIN> hereafter her own . he had certainly formed such a plan , and without <END>
<BEGIN> meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss <END>
<BEGIN> bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern <END>
<BEGIN> for the welfare of his friend . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and <END>
<BEGIN> as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able <END>
<BEGIN> to speak any more . her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely <END>
<BEGIN> recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which <END>
<BEGIN> had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have <END>
<BEGIN> fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . <END>
<BEGIN> their visit did not continue long after the question and answer <END>
<BEGIN> above mentioned ; and while mr . darcy was attending them to their <END>
<BEGIN> carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress . but georgiana would not join <END>
<BEGIN> her . her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his <END>
<BEGIN> judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as <END>
<BEGIN> to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than <END>
<BEGIN> lovely and amiable . when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley <END>
<BEGIN> could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to <END>
<BEGIN> his sister . <END>
<BEGIN> " how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr . darcy she cried ; " i <END>
<BEGIN> never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . <END>
<BEGIN> she is grown so brown and coarse ! louisa and i were agreeing that we <END>
<BEGIN> should not have known her <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> however little mr . darcy might have liked such an address , he contented <END>
<BEGIN> himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than <END>
<BEGIN> her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the <END>
<BEGIN> summer . <END>
<BEGIN> " for my own part she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see <END>
<BEGIN> any beauty in her . her face is too thin ; her complexion has no <END>
<BEGIN> brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . her nose wants <END>
<BEGIN> character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . her teeth are <END>
<BEGIN> tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which <END>
<BEGIN> have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing <END>
<BEGIN> extraordinary in them . they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not <END>
<BEGIN> like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency <END>
<BEGIN> without fashion , which is <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not <END>
<BEGIN> the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always <END>
<BEGIN> wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the <END>
<BEGIN> success she expected . he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a <END>
<BEGIN> determination of making him speak , she continued , <END>
<BEGIN> " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all <END>
<BEGIN> were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect <END>
<BEGIN> your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , she _ <END>
<BEGIN> a beauty i should as soon call her mother a <URL> but afterwards she <END>
<BEGIN> seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at <END>
<BEGIN> one <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _ that _ <END>
<BEGIN> was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have <END>
<BEGIN> considered her as one of the handsomest women of my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of <END>
<BEGIN> having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during <END>
<BEGIN> their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested <END>
<BEGIN> them both . the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were <END>
<BEGIN> discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . <END>
<BEGIN> they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every <END>
<BEGIN> thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs . gardiner <END>
<BEGIN> thought of him , and mrs . gardiner would have been highly gratified by <END>
<BEGIN> her niece ' s beginning the subject . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter iv . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from <END>
<BEGIN> jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had <END>
<BEGIN> been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but <END>
<BEGIN> on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the <END>
<BEGIN> receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that <END>
<BEGIN> it had been missent elsewhere . elizabeth was not surprised at it , as <END>
<BEGIN> jane had written the direction remarkably ill . <END>
<BEGIN> they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her <END>
<BEGIN> uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by <END>
<BEGIN> themselves . the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been <END>
<BEGIN> written five days ago . the beginning contained an account of all their <END>
<BEGIN> little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; <END>
<BEGIN> but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident <END>
<BEGIN> agitation , gave more important intelligence . it was to this effect : <END>
<BEGIN> " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of <END>
<BEGIN> a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming <END>
<BEGIN> you be assured that we are all well . what i have to say relates to <END>
<BEGIN> poor lydia . an express came at twelve last night , just as we were <END>
<BEGIN> all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was <END>
<BEGIN> gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , <END>
<BEGIN> with wickham imagine our surprise . to kitty , however , it does not <END>
<BEGIN> seem so wholly unexpected . i am very , very sorry . so imprudent a <END>
<BEGIN> match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best , and that <END>
<BEGIN> his character has been misunderstood . thoughtless and indiscreet i <END>
<BEGIN> can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) <END>
<BEGIN> marks nothing bad at heart . his choice is disinterested at least , <END>
<BEGIN> for he must know my father can give her nothing . our poor mother <END>
<BEGIN> is sadly grieved . my father bears it better . how thankful am i , <END>
<BEGIN> that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must <END>
<BEGIN> forget it ourselves . they were off saturday night about twelve , as <END>
<BEGIN> is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at <END>
<BEGIN> eight . the express was sent off directly . my dear lizzy , they must <END>
<BEGIN> have passed within ten miles of us . colonel forster gives us reason <END>
<BEGIN> to expect him here soon . lydia left a few lines for his wife , <END>
<BEGIN> informing her of their intention . i must conclude , for i cannot be <END>
<BEGIN> long from my poor mother . i am afraid you will not be able to make <END>
<BEGIN> it out , but i hardly know what i have <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing <END>
<BEGIN> what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the <END>
<BEGIN> other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it <END>
<BEGIN> had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . <END>
<BEGIN> " by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried <END>
<BEGIN> letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not <END>
<BEGIN> confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer <END>
<BEGIN> for being coherent . dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would <END>
<BEGIN> write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . <END>
<BEGIN> imprudent as a marriage between mr . wickham and our poor lydia <END>
<BEGIN> would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for <END>
<BEGIN> there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland . <END>
<BEGIN> colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day <END>
<BEGIN> before , not many hours after the express . though lydia ' s short <END>
<BEGIN> letter to mrs . f . gave them to understand that they were going to <END>
<BEGIN> gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief <END>
<BEGIN> that w . never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which <END>
<BEGIN> was repeated to colonel f . who instantly taking the alarm , set off <END>
<BEGIN> from b . intending to trace their route . he did trace them easily to <END>
<BEGIN> clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed <END>
<BEGIN> into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them <END>
<BEGIN> from epsom . all that is known after this is , that they were seen <END>
<BEGIN> to continue the london road . i know not what to think . after making <END>
<BEGIN> every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f . came on into <END>
<BEGIN> hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at <END>
<BEGIN> the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such <END>
<BEGIN> people had been seen to pass through . with the kindest concern he <END>
<BEGIN> came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner <END>
<BEGIN> most creditable to his heart . i am sincerely grieved for him and <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . f . but no one can throw any blame on them . our distress , my <END>
<BEGIN> dear lizzy , is very great . my father and mother believe the worst , <END>
<BEGIN> but i cannot think so ill of him . many circumstances might make it <END>
<BEGIN> more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to <END>
<BEGIN> pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design <END>
<BEGIN> against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , <END>
<BEGIN> can i suppose her so lost to every thing impossible . i grieve to <END>
<BEGIN> find , however , that colonel f . is not disposed to depend upon their <END>
<BEGIN> marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he <END>
<BEGIN> feared w . was not a man to be trusted . my poor mother is really ill <END>
<BEGIN> and keeps her room . could she exert herself it would be better , but <END>
<BEGIN> this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life <END>
<BEGIN> saw him so affected . poor kitty has anger for having concealed <END>
<BEGIN> their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot <END>
<BEGIN> wonder . i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared <END>
<BEGIN> something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock <END>
<BEGIN> is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? i am not so <END>
<BEGIN> selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . adieu . i <END>
<BEGIN> take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , <END>
<BEGIN> but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging <END>
<BEGIN> you all to come here , as soon as possible . i know my dear uncle and <END>
<BEGIN> aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have <END>
<BEGIN> still something more to ask of the former . my father is going to <END>
<BEGIN> london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her . what <END>
<BEGIN> he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress <END>
<BEGIN> will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest <END>
<BEGIN> way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again <END>
<BEGIN> to morrow evening . in such an exigence my uncle ' s advice and <END>
<BEGIN> assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately <END>
<BEGIN> comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! where , where is my uncle cried elizabeth , darting from her seat <END>
<BEGIN> as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a <END>
<BEGIN> moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was <END>
<BEGIN> opened by a servant , and mr . darcy appeared . her pale face and impetuous <END>
<BEGIN> manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to <END>
<BEGIN> speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ' s <END>
<BEGIN> situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you . <END>
<BEGIN> i must find mr . gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be <END>
<BEGIN> delayed ; i have not an instant to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " good god ! what is the matter cried he , with more feeling than <END>
<BEGIN> politeness ; then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , <END>
<BEGIN> but let me , or let the servant , go after mr . and mrs . gardiner . you are <END>
<BEGIN> not well enough you cannot go <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how <END>
<BEGIN> little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . calling back <END>
<BEGIN> the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an <END>
<BEGIN> accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and <END>
<BEGIN> mistress home , instantly . <END>
<BEGIN> on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and <END>
<BEGIN> looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , <END>
<BEGIN> or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , <END>
<BEGIN> " let me call your maid . is there nothing you could take , to give you <END>
<BEGIN> present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no , i thank you she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . " there <END>
<BEGIN> is nothing the matter with me . i am quite well . i am only distressed by <END>
<BEGIN> some dreadful news which i have just received from <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could <END>
<BEGIN> not speak another word . darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say <END>
<BEGIN> something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate <END>
<BEGIN> silence . at length , she spoke again . " i have just had a letter from <END>
<BEGIN> jane , with such dreadful news . it cannot be concealed from any one . my <END>
<BEGIN> youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown <END>
<BEGIN> herself into the power of of mr . wickham . they are gone off together <END>
<BEGIN> from brighton . _ you _ know him too well to doubt the rest . she has no <END>
<BEGIN> money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> darcy was fixed in astonishment . " when i consider she added , in a yet <END>
<BEGIN> more agitated voice , " that _ i _ might have prevented it i _ who knew <END>
<BEGIN> what he was . had i but explained some part of it only some part of what <END>
<BEGIN> i learnt , to my own family ! had his character been known , this could not <END>
<BEGIN> have happened . but it is all , all too late <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am grieved , indeed cried darcy ; " grieved shocked . but is it <END>
<BEGIN> certain , absolutely certain <END>
<BEGIN> " oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced <END>
<BEGIN> almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her <END>
<BEGIN> " my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle ' s <END>
<BEGIN> immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour . but <END>
<BEGIN> nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done . how is <END>
<BEGIN> such a man to be worked on ? how are they even to be discovered ? i have <END>
<BEGIN> not the smallest hope . it is every way horrible <END>
<BEGIN> darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence . <END>
<BEGIN> " when _ my _ eyes were opened to his real <URL> had i known what <END>
<BEGIN> i ought , what i dared , to do ! but i knew not i was afraid of doing too <END>
<BEGIN> much . wretched , wretched , mistake <END>
<BEGIN> darcy made no answer . he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up <END>
<BEGIN> and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air <END>
<BEGIN> gloomy . elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . her power <END>
<BEGIN> was sinking ; every thing _ must _ sink under such a proof of family <END>
<BEGIN> weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . she could neither <END>
<BEGIN> wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing <END>
<BEGIN> consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . it <END>
<BEGIN> was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own <END>
<BEGIN> wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved <END>
<BEGIN> him , as now , when all love must be vain . <END>
<BEGIN> but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . lydia the <END>
<BEGIN> humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up <END>
<BEGIN> every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of <END>
<BEGIN> several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the <END>
<BEGIN> voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke <END>
<BEGIN> compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been <END>
<BEGIN> long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my <END>
<BEGIN> stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . would to heaven that any <END>
<BEGIN> thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer <END>
<BEGIN> consolation to such <URL> i will not torment you with vain <END>
<BEGIN> wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . this <END>
<BEGIN> unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure <END>
<BEGIN> of seeing you at pemberley <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , yes . be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy . say that <END>
<BEGIN> urgent business calls us home immediately . conceal the unhappy truth as <END>
<BEGIN> long as it is <URL> know it cannot be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for <END>
<BEGIN> her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present <END>
<BEGIN> reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only <END>
<BEGIN> one serious , parting , look , went away . <END>
<BEGIN> as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they <END>
<BEGIN> should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had <END>
<BEGIN> marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a <END>
<BEGIN> retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <END>
<BEGIN> contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those <END>
<BEGIN> feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would <END>
<BEGIN> formerly have rejoiced in its termination . <END>
<BEGIN> if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ' s <END>
<BEGIN> change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . but if <END>
<BEGIN> otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or <END>
<BEGIN> unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a <END>
<BEGIN> first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <END>
<BEGIN> exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given <END>
<BEGIN> somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , <END>
<BEGIN> and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other <END>
<BEGIN> less interesting mode of attachment . be that as it may , she saw him go <END>
<BEGIN> with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must <END>
<BEGIN> produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched <END>
<BEGIN> business . never , since reading jane ' s second letter , had she entertained <END>
<BEGIN> a hope of wickham ' s meaning to marry her . no one but jane , she thought , <END>
<BEGIN> could flatter herself with such an expectation . surprise was the least <END>
<BEGIN> of her feelings on this developement . while the contents of the first <END>
<BEGIN> letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that <END>
<BEGIN> wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for <END>
<BEGIN> money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared <END>
<BEGIN> incomprehensible . but now it was all too natural . for such an attachment <END>
<BEGIN> as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not <END>
<BEGIN> suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the <END>
<BEGIN> intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither <END>
<BEGIN> her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy <END>
<BEGIN> prey . <END>
<BEGIN> she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that <END>
<BEGIN> lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had <END>
<BEGIN> wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . sometimes one <END>
<BEGIN> officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions <END>
<BEGIN> raised them in her opinion . her affections had been continually <END>
<BEGIN> fluctuating , but never without an object . the mischief of neglect and <END>
<BEGIN> mistaken indulgence towards such a <URL> how acutely did she now <END>
<BEGIN> feel it . <END>
<BEGIN> she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to <END>
<BEGIN> share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a <END>
<BEGIN> family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and <END>
<BEGIN> requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing <END>
<BEGIN> could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost <END>
<BEGIN> importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience <END>
<BEGIN> was severe . mr . and mrs . gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , <END>
<BEGIN> by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill but <END>
<BEGIN> satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the <END>
<BEGIN> cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on <END>
<BEGIN> the postscript of the last , with trembling <URL> lydia had <END>
<BEGIN> never been a favourite with them , mr . and mrs . gardiner could not but be <END>
<BEGIN> deeply affected . not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after <END>
<BEGIN> the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr . gardiner readily <END>
<BEGIN> promised every assistance in his <URL> though expecting no <END>
<BEGIN> less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated <END>
<BEGIN> by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily <END>
<BEGIN> settled . they were to be off as soon as possible . " but what is to be <END>
<BEGIN> done about pemberley cried mrs . gardiner . " john told us mr . darcy was <END>
<BEGIN> here when you sent for us was it so <END>
<BEGIN> " yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . <END>
<BEGIN> _ that _ is all <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is all settled repeated the other , as she ran into her room to <END>
<BEGIN> prepare . " and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real <END>
<BEGIN> truth ! oh , that i knew how it was <END>
<BEGIN> but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the <END>
<BEGIN> hurry and confusion of the following hour . had elizabeth been at leisure <END>
<BEGIN> to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was <END>
<BEGIN> impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of <END>
<BEGIN> business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to <END>
<BEGIN> be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their <END>
<BEGIN> sudden departure . an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr . <END>
<BEGIN> gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing <END>
<BEGIN> remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of <END>
<BEGIN> the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could <END>
<BEGIN> have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter v . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth said her uncle , as they <END>
<BEGIN> drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , i am much <END>
<BEGIN> more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the <END>
<BEGIN> matter . it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should <END>
<BEGIN> form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or <END>
<BEGIN> friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i <END>
<BEGIN> am strongly inclined to hope the best . could he expect that her friends <END>
<BEGIN> would not step forward ? could he expect to be noticed again by the <END>
<BEGIN> regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? his temptation is <END>
<BEGIN> not adequate to the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " do you really think so cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . <END>
<BEGIN> " upon my word said mrs . gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle ' s <END>
<BEGIN> opinion . it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and <END>
<BEGIN> interest , for him to be guilty of it . i cannot think so very ill of <END>
<BEGIN> wickham . can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe <END>
<BEGIN> him capable of it <END>
<BEGIN> " not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . but of every other neglect <END>
<BEGIN> i can believe him capable . if , indeed , it should be so ! but i dare not <END>
<BEGIN> hope it . why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the <END>
<BEGIN> case <END>
<BEGIN> " in the first place replied mr . gardiner , " there is no absolute proof <END>
<BEGIN> that they are not gone to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a <END>
<BEGIN> presumption ! and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the <END>
<BEGIN> barnet <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " well , then supposing them to be in london . they may be there , though <END>
<BEGIN> for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . it is <END>
<BEGIN> not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it <END>
<BEGIN> might strike them that they could be more economically , though less <END>
<BEGIN> expeditiously , married in london , than in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but why all this secrecy ? why any fear of detection ? why must their <END>
<BEGIN> marriage be private ? oh ! no , no , this is not likely . his most particular <END>
<BEGIN> friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending <END>
<BEGIN> to marry her . wickham will never marry a woman without some money . he <END>
<BEGIN> cannot afford it . and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she <END>
<BEGIN> beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , <END>
<BEGIN> forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? as to what <END>
<BEGIN> restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a <END>
<BEGIN> dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know <END>
<BEGIN> nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . but as to your <END>
<BEGIN> other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good . lydia has no <END>
<BEGIN> brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s <END>
<BEGIN> behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever <END>
<BEGIN> seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would <END>
<BEGIN> do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in <END>
<BEGIN> such a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , <END>
<BEGIN> as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage <END>
<BEGIN> " it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth , with <END>
<BEGIN> tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such <END>
<BEGIN> a point should admit of doubt . but , really , i know not what to say . <END>
<BEGIN> perhaps i am not doing her justice . but she is very young ; she has never <END>
<BEGIN> been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , <END>
<BEGIN> nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement <END>
<BEGIN> and vanity . she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle <END>
<BEGIN> and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . <END>
<BEGIN> since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , <END>
<BEGIN> flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . she has been doing <END>
<BEGIN> every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give <END>
<BEGIN> greater what shall i call it ? susceptibility to her feelings ; which are <END>
<BEGIN> naturally lively enough . and we all know that wickham has every charm of <END>
<BEGIN> person and address that can captivate a <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but you see that jane said her aunt , " does not think so ill of <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , as to believe him capable of the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " of whom does jane ever think ill ? and who is there , whatever might be <END>
<BEGIN> their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , <END>
<BEGIN> till it were proved against them ? but jane knows , as well as i do , what <END>
<BEGIN> wickham really is . we both know that he has been profligate in every <END>
<BEGIN> sense of the word . that he has neither integrity nor honour . that he is <END>
<BEGIN> as false and deceitful , as he is <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and do you really know all this cried mrs . gardiner , whose curiosity <END>
<BEGIN> as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive . <END>
<BEGIN> " i do , indeed replied elizabeth , colouring . " i told you the other day , <END>
<BEGIN> of his infamous behaviour to mr . darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved <END>
<BEGIN> with such forbearance and liberality towards him . and there are other <END>
<BEGIN> circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to <END>
<BEGIN> relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless . from <END>
<BEGIN> what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , <END>
<BEGIN> reserved , disagreeable girl . yet he knew to the contrary himself . he <END>
<BEGIN> must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you <END>
<BEGIN> and jane seem so well to understand <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , yes that , that is the worst of all . till i was in kent , and saw <END>
<BEGIN> so much both of mr . darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was <END>
<BEGIN> ignorant of the truth myself . and when i returned home , the shire <END>
<BEGIN> was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time . as that was the <END>
<BEGIN> case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it <END>
<BEGIN> necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it <END>
<BEGIN> apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? and even when it <END>
<BEGIN> was settled that lydia should go with mrs . forster , the necessity of <END>
<BEGIN> opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . that _ she _ could <END>
<BEGIN> be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . that such a <END>
<BEGIN> consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far <END>
<BEGIN> enough from my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i <END>
<BEGIN> suppose , to believe them fond of each <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " not the slightest . i can remember no symptom of affection on either <END>
<BEGIN> side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware <END>
<BEGIN> that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . when first <END>
<BEGIN> he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all <END>
<BEGIN> were . every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him <END>
<BEGIN> for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _ her _ by any <END>
<BEGIN> particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of <END>
<BEGIN> extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others <END>
<BEGIN> of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> * * * * * <END>
<BEGIN> it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added <END>
<BEGIN> to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by <END>
<BEGIN> its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during <END>
<BEGIN> the whole of the journey . from elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent . <END>
<BEGIN> fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find <END>
<BEGIN> no interval of ease or forgetfulness . <END>
<BEGIN> they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on <END>
<BEGIN> the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day . it was a <END>
<BEGIN> comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied <END>
<BEGIN> by long expectations . <END>
<BEGIN> the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing <END>
<BEGIN> on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the <END>
<BEGIN> carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their <END>
<BEGIN> faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of <END>
<BEGIN> capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , <END>
<BEGIN> hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs <END>
<BEGIN> from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the <END>
<BEGIN> eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been <END>
<BEGIN> heard of the fugitives . <END>
<BEGIN> " not yet replied jane . " but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope <END>
<BEGIN> every thing will be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " is my father in town <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and have you heard from him often <END>
<BEGIN> " we have heard only once . he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say <END>
<BEGIN> that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i <END>
<BEGIN> particularly begged him to do . he merely added , that he should not write <END>
<BEGIN> again , till he had something of importance to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and my mother how is she ? how are you all <END>
<BEGIN> " my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly <END>
<BEGIN> shaken . she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you <END>
<BEGIN> all . she does not yet leave her dressing room . mary and kitty , thank <END>
<BEGIN> heaven ! are quite <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but you how are you cried elizabeth . " you look pale . how much you <END>
<BEGIN> must have gone through <END>
<BEGIN> her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their <END>
<BEGIN> conversation , which had been passing while mr . and mrs . gardiner were <END>
<BEGIN> engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of <END>
<BEGIN> the whole party . jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and <END>
<BEGIN> thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . <END>
<BEGIN> when they were all in the drawing room , the questions which elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon <END>
<BEGIN> found that jane had no intelligence to give . the sanguine hope of good , <END>
<BEGIN> however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <END>
<BEGIN> deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that <END>
<BEGIN> every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , <END>
<BEGIN> to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes <END>
<BEGIN> conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with <END>
<BEGIN> tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous <END>
<BEGIN> conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; <END>
<BEGIN> blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the <END>
<BEGIN> errors of her daughter must be principally owing . <END>
<BEGIN> " if i had been able said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , <END>
<BEGIN> with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia <END>
<BEGIN> had nobody to take care of her . why did the forsters ever let her go out <END>
<BEGIN> of their sight ? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their <END>
<BEGIN> side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had <END>
<BEGIN> been well looked after . i always thought they were very unfit to have <END>
<BEGIN> the charge of her ; but i was over ruled , as i always am . poor dear <END>
<BEGIN> child ! and now here ' s mr . bennet gone away , and i know he will fight <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is <END>
<BEGIN> to become of us all ? the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold <END>
<BEGIN> in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what <END>
<BEGIN> we shall <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr . gardiner , after <END>
<BEGIN> general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told <END>
<BEGIN> her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia . <END>
<BEGIN> " do not give way to useless alarm added he , " though it is right to be <END>
<BEGIN> prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . <END>
<BEGIN> it is not quite a week since they left brighton . in a few days more , we <END>
<BEGIN> may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , <END>
<BEGIN> and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as <END>
<BEGIN> lost . as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him <END>
<BEGIN> come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult <END>
<BEGIN> together as to what is to be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! my dear brother replied mrs . bennet , " that is exactly what i <END>
<BEGIN> could most wish for . and now do , when you get to town , find them out , <END>
<BEGIN> wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them <END>
<BEGIN> marry . and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but <END>
<BEGIN> tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , <END>
<BEGIN> after they are married . and , above all things , keep mr . bennet from <END>
<BEGIN> fighting . tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened <END>
<BEGIN> out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , <END>
<BEGIN> such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at <END>
<BEGIN> heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day . and tell my dear <END>
<BEGIN> lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen <END>
<BEGIN> me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . oh , brother , <END>
<BEGIN> how kind you are ! i know you will contrive it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but mr . gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours <END>
<BEGIN> in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in <END>
<BEGIN> her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till <END>
<BEGIN> dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the <END>
<BEGIN> housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . <END>
<BEGIN> though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real <END>
<BEGIN> occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to <END>
<BEGIN> oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her <END>
<BEGIN> tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it <END>
<BEGIN> better that _ one _ only of the household , and the one whom they could <END>
<BEGIN> most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the <END>
<BEGIN> subject . <END>
<BEGIN> in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been <END>
<BEGIN> too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their <END>
<BEGIN> appearance before . one came from her books , and the other from her <END>
<BEGIN> toilette . the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change <END>
<BEGIN> was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or <END>
<BEGIN> the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given <END>
<BEGIN> something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty . as <END>
<BEGIN> for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at <END>
<BEGIN> table , <END>
<BEGIN> " this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . <END>
<BEGIN> but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of <END>
<BEGIN> each other , the balm of sisterly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , <END>
<BEGIN> " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful <END>
<BEGIN> lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false <END>
<BEGIN> step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less <END>
<BEGIN> brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded <END>
<BEGIN> in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to <END>
<BEGIN> make any reply . mary , however , continued to console herself with such <END>
<BEGIN> kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . <END>
<BEGIN> in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an <END>
<BEGIN> hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the <END>
<BEGIN> opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to <END>
<BEGIN> satisfy . after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel <END>
<BEGIN> of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss <END>
<BEGIN> bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued <END>
<BEGIN> the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which <END>
<BEGIN> i have not already heard . give me farther particulars . what did colonel <END>
<BEGIN> forster say ? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement <END>
<BEGIN> took place ? they must have seen them together for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , <END>
<BEGIN> especially on lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . i am so <END>
<BEGIN> grieved for him . his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . he <END>
<BEGIN> _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had <END>
<BEGIN> any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension <END>
<BEGIN> first got abroad , it hastened his <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? did he know of <END>
<BEGIN> their intending to go off ? had colonel forster seen denny himself <END>
<BEGIN> " yes ; but when questioned by _ him _ denny denied knowing any thing of <END>
<BEGIN> their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . he did not <END>
<BEGIN> repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from _ that i am <END>
<BEGIN> inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a <END>
<BEGIN> doubt , i suppose , of their being really married <END>
<BEGIN> " how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! i felt a <END>
<BEGIN> little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in <END>
<BEGIN> marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite <END>
<BEGIN> right . my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how <END>
<BEGIN> imprudent a match it must be . kitty then owned , with a very natural <END>
<BEGIN> triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia ' s last <END>
<BEGIN> letter , she had prepared her for such a step . she had known , it seems , <END>
<BEGIN> of their being in love with each other , many <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but not before they went to brighton <END>
<BEGIN> " no , i believe <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ? does he <END>
<BEGIN> know his real character <END>
<BEGIN> " i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly <END>
<BEGIN> did . he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . and since this sad <END>
<BEGIN> affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in <END>
<BEGIN> debt ; but i hope this may be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , <END>
<BEGIN> this could not have happened <END>
<BEGIN> " perhaps it would have been better replied her sister . " but to expose <END>
<BEGIN> the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present <END>
<BEGIN> feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . we acted with the best <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ' s note to his <END>
<BEGIN> wife <END>

<BEGIN> were the contents : <END>

<BEGIN> " oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had <END>
<BEGIN> finished it . " what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . but <END>
<BEGIN> at least it shews , that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . <END>
<BEGIN> whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a <END>

<BEGIN> " i never saw any one so shocked . he could not speak a word for full ten <END>

<BEGIN> kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours <END>
<BEGIN> of repose should not be broken in on . my aunt philips came to longbourn <END>
<BEGIN> on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till <END>
<BEGIN> thursday with me . she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady <END>
<BEGIN> lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to <END>

<BEGIN> she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had <END>
<BEGIN> intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . <END>
<BEGIN> " he meant , i believe replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where <END>
<BEGIN> they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could <END>
<BEGIN> be made out from them . his principal object must be , to discover the <END>
<BEGIN> number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham . it had come <END>
<BEGIN> with a fare from london ; and as he thought the circumstance of a <END>
<BEGIN> gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be <END>
<BEGIN> remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham . if he could any how <END>
<BEGIN> discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he <END>
<BEGIN> determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible <END>
<BEGIN> to find out the stand and number of the coach . i do not know of any <END>
<BEGIN> other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , <END>
<BEGIN> and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding <END>
<BEGIN> out even so much as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> chapter vi . <END>
<BEGIN> the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr . bennet the next <END>
<BEGIN> morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . <END>
<BEGIN> his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and <END>
<BEGIN> dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . <END>
<BEGIN> they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to <END>
<BEGIN> send , but even of _ that _ they would have been glad to be certain . mr . <END>
<BEGIN> gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . <END>
<BEGIN> when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant <END>
<BEGIN> information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , <END>
<BEGIN> to prevail on mr . bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to <END>
<BEGIN> the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only <END>
<BEGIN> security for her husband ' s not being killed in a duel . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few <END>
<BEGIN> days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to <END>
<BEGIN> her nieces . she shared in their attendance on mrs . bennet , and was a <END>
<BEGIN> great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . their other aunt also <END>
<BEGIN> visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of <END>
<BEGIN> cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without <END>
<BEGIN> reporting some fresh instance of wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , <END>
<BEGIN> she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found <END>
<BEGIN> them . <END>
<BEGIN> all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months <END>
<BEGIN> before , had been almost an angel of light . he was declared to be in debt <END>
<BEGIN> to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with <END>
<BEGIN> the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family . <END>
<BEGIN> every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; <END>
<BEGIN> and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the <END>
<BEGIN> appearance of his goodness . elizabeth , though she did not credit above <END>
<BEGIN> half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of <END>
<BEGIN> her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still <END>
<BEGIN> less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now <END>
<BEGIN> come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before <END>
<BEGIN> entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some <END>
<BEGIN> news of them . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a <END>
<BEGIN> letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately <END>
<BEGIN> found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street . <END>
<BEGIN> that mr . bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but <END>
<BEGIN> without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now <END>
<BEGIN> determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr . bennet <END>
<BEGIN> thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first <END>
<BEGIN> coming to london , before they procured lodgings . mr . gardiner himself <END>
<BEGIN> did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was <END>
<BEGIN> eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . he added , that mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and <END>
<BEGIN> promised to write again very soon . there was also a postscript to this <END>
<BEGIN> effect . <END>
<BEGIN> " i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if <END>
<BEGIN> possible , from some of the young man ' s intimates in the regiment , <END>
<BEGIN> whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to <END>
<BEGIN> know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . if there <END>
<BEGIN> were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining <END>
<BEGIN> such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . at present we <END>
<BEGIN> have nothing to guide us . colonel forster will , i dare say , do every <END>
<BEGIN> thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . but , on second thoughts , <END>
<BEGIN> perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better <END>
<BEGIN> than any other <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for <END>
<BEGIN> her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any <END>
<BEGIN> information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . <END>
<BEGIN> she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and <END>
<BEGIN> mother , both of whom had been dead many years . it was possible , however , <END>
<BEGIN> that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more <END>
<BEGIN> information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the <END>
<BEGIN> application was a something to look forward to . <END>
<BEGIN> every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious <END>
<BEGIN> part of each was when the post was expected . the arrival of letters was <END>
<BEGIN> the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience . through letters , <END>
<BEGIN> whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every <END>
<BEGIN> succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . <END>
<BEGIN> but before they heard again from mr . gardiner , a letter arrived for <END>
<BEGIN> their father , from a different quarter , from mr . collins ; which , as jane <END>
<BEGIN> had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , <END>
<BEGIN> she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his <END>
<BEGIN> letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . it was as <END>
<BEGIN> follows : <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear sir , <END>
<BEGIN> " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation <END>
<BEGIN> in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now <END>
<BEGIN> suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter <END>
<BEGIN> from hertfordshire . be assured , my dear sir , that mrs . collins and <END>
<BEGIN> myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable <END>
<BEGIN> family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest <END>
<BEGIN> kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . no <END>
<BEGIN> arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe <END>
<BEGIN> a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that <END>
<BEGIN> must be of all others most afflicting to a parent ' s mind . the death <END>
<BEGIN> of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . <END>
<BEGIN> and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to <END>
<BEGIN> suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness <END>
<BEGIN> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree <END>
<BEGIN> of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of <END>
<BEGIN> yourself and mrs . bennet , i am inclined to think that her own <END>
<BEGIN> disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of <END>
<BEGIN> such an enormity , at so early an age . howsoever that may be , you <END>
<BEGIN> are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined <END>
<BEGIN> by mrs . collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , <END>
<BEGIN> to whom i have related the affair . they agree with me in <END>
<BEGIN> apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be <END>
<BEGIN> injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves <END>
<BEGIN> with such a family . and this consideration leads me moreover to <END>
<BEGIN> reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last <END>
<BEGIN> november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in <END>
<BEGIN> all your sorrow and disgrace . let me advise you then , my dear sir , <END>
<BEGIN> to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy <END>
<BEGIN> child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the <END>
<BEGIN> fruits of her own heinous offence . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am , dear sir , & c . <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from <END>
<BEGIN> colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . <END>
<BEGIN> it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept <END>
<BEGIN> up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . <END>
<BEGIN> his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the <END>
<BEGIN> militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship <END>
<BEGIN> with any of them . there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , <END>
<BEGIN> as likely to give any news of him . and in the wretched state of his own <END>
<BEGIN> finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to <END>
<BEGIN> his fear of discovery by lydia ' s relations , for it had just transpired <END>
<BEGIN> that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable <END>
<BEGIN> amount . colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would <END>
<BEGIN> be necessary to clear his expences at brighton . he owed a good deal in <END>
<BEGIN> the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . mr . <END>
<BEGIN> gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn <END>
<BEGIN> family ; jane heard them with horror . " a gamester she cried . " this is <END>
<BEGIN> wholly unexpected . i had not an idea of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their <END>
<BEGIN> father at home on the following day , which was saturday . rendered <END>
<BEGIN> spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to <END>
<BEGIN> his brother in - law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and <END>
<BEGIN> leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable <END>
<BEGIN> for continuing their pursuit . when mrs . bennet was told of this , she did <END>
<BEGIN> not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering <END>
<BEGIN> what her anxiety for his life had been before . <END>
<BEGIN> " what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia she cried . " sure he <END>
<BEGIN> will not leave london before he has found them . who is to fight wickham , <END>
<BEGIN> and make him marry her , if he comes away <END>
<BEGIN> as mrs . gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she <END>
<BEGIN> and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr . bennet <END>
<BEGIN> came from it . the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their <END>
<BEGIN> journey , and brought its master back to longbourn . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her <END>
<BEGIN> derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . <END>
<BEGIN> his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; <END>
<BEGIN> and the kind of half expectation which mrs . gardiner had formed , of <END>
<BEGIN> their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley . <END>
<BEGIN> the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for <END>
<BEGIN> the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be <END>
<BEGIN> fairly conjectured from _ that though elizabeth , who was by this time <END>
<BEGIN> tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , <END>
<BEGIN> that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of <END>
<BEGIN> lydia ' s infamy somewhat better . it would have spared her , she thought , <END>
<BEGIN> one sleepless night out of two . <END>
<BEGIN> when mr . bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual <END>
<BEGIN> philosophic composure . he said as little as he had ever been in the <END>
<BEGIN> habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him <END>
<BEGIN> away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of <END>
<BEGIN> it . <END>
<BEGIN> it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly <END>
<BEGIN> expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " say <END>
<BEGIN> nothing of that . who should suffer but myself ? it has been my own doing , <END>
<BEGIN> and i ought to feel <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> " you may well warn me against such an evil . human nature is so prone to <END>
<BEGIN> fall into it ! no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have <END>
<BEGIN> been to blame . i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . <END>
<BEGIN> it will pass away soon <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " do you suppose them to be in london <END>
<BEGIN> " yes ; where else can they be so well concealed <END>

<BEGIN> " this is a parade cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an <END>
<BEGIN> elegance to misfortune ! another day i will do the same ; i will sit in <END>

<BEGIN> chapter vii . <END>
<BEGIN> two days after mr . bennet ' s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking <END>
<BEGIN> together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper <END>
<BEGIN> coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their <END>
<BEGIN> mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , <END>
<BEGIN> when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , <END>
<BEGIN> madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some <END>
<BEGIN> good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " dear madam cried mrs . hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know <END>
<BEGIN> there is an express come for master from mr . gardiner ? he has been here <END>
<BEGIN> this half hour , and master has had a <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the <END>
<BEGIN> library their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of <END>
<BEGIN> seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <END>
<BEGIN> butler , who said , <END>
<BEGIN> " if you are looking for my master , ma ' am , he is walking towards the <END>
<BEGIN> little <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , <END>
<BEGIN> and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately <END>
<BEGIN> pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . <END>
<BEGIN> jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , <END>
<BEGIN> came up with him , and eagerly cried out , <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , i have had a letter from him by <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " well , and what news does it bring ? good or bad <END>
<BEGIN> " what is there of good to be expected said he , taking the letter from <END>
<BEGIN> his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . jane now came up . <END>

<BEGIN> it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them <END>

<BEGIN> nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are <END>
<BEGIN> willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on <END>

<BEGIN> moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your <END>

<BEGIN> before . his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! oh ! <END>

<BEGIN> farthing less than ten thousand pounds . i should be sorry to think so <END>
<BEGIN> ill of him , in the very beginning of our <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " ten thousand pounds ! heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be <END>
<BEGIN> repaid <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued <END>
<BEGIN> silent till they reached the house . their father then went to the <END>
<BEGIN> library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room . <END>
<BEGIN> " and they are really to be married cried elizabeth , as soon as they <END>
<BEGIN> were by themselves . " how strange this is ! and for _ this _ we are to be <END>
<BEGIN> thankful . that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , <END>
<BEGIN> and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! oh , lydia <END>
<BEGIN> " i comfort myself with thinking replied jane , " that he certainly would <END>
<BEGIN> not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . though our kind <END>
<BEGIN> uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten <END>
<BEGIN> thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . he has <END>
<BEGIN> children of his own , and may have more . how could he spare half ten <END>
<BEGIN> thousand pounds <END>
<BEGIN> " if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been said <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall <END>
<BEGIN> exactly know what mr . gardiner has done for them , because wickham has <END>
<BEGIN> not sixpence of his own . the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <END>
<BEGIN> requited . their taking her home , and affording her their personal <END>
<BEGIN> protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as <END>
<BEGIN> years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . by this time she is <END>
<BEGIN> actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , <END>
<BEGIN> she will never deserve to be happy ! what a meeting for her , when she <END>
<BEGIN> first sees my aunt <END>
<BEGIN> " we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said <END>
<BEGIN> jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy . his consenting to marry <END>
<BEGIN> her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of <END>
<BEGIN> thinking . their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself <END>
<BEGIN> they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in <END>
<BEGIN> time make their past imprudence <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " their conduct has been such replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor <END>
<BEGIN> i , nor any body , can ever forget . it is useless to talk of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood <END>
<BEGIN> perfectly ignorant of what had happened . they went to the library , <END>
<BEGIN> therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to <END>
<BEGIN> make it known to her . he was writing , and , without raising his head , <END>
<BEGIN> coolly replied , <END>

<BEGIN> elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up <END>
<BEGIN> stairs together . mary and kitty were both with mrs . bennet : one <END>
<BEGIN> communication would , therefore , do for all . after a slight preparation <END>
<BEGIN> for good news , the letter was read aloud . mrs . bennet could hardly <END>
<BEGIN> contain herself . as soon as jane had read mr . gardiner ' s hope of lydia ' s <END>
<BEGIN> being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence <END>
<BEGIN> added to its exuberance . she was now in an irritation as violent from <END>
<BEGIN> delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation . to know <END>
<BEGIN> that her daughter would be married was enough . she was disturbed by no <END>
<BEGIN> fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear , dear lydia she cried : " this is delightful indeed she will <END>
<BEGIN> be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my <END>

<BEGIN> her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of <END>
<BEGIN> these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr . <END>
<BEGIN> gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under . <END>
<BEGIN> " for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added , " in a great <END>
<BEGIN> measure , to his kindness . we are persuaded that he has pledged himself <END>
<BEGIN> to assist mr . wickham with <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> afterwards ; but the things should be ordered <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and <END>
<BEGIN> cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had <END>
<BEGIN> not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her <END>
<BEGIN> father was at leisure to be consulted . one day ' s delay she observed , <END>
<BEGIN> would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite <END>
<BEGIN> so obstinate as usual . other schemes too came into her head . <END>

<BEGIN> mrs . hill began instantly to express her joy . elizabeth received her <END>
<BEGIN> congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took <END>
<BEGIN> refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . <END>
<BEGIN> poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no <END>
<BEGIN> worse , she had need to be thankful . she felt it so ; and though , in <END>
<BEGIN> looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , <END>
<BEGIN> could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they <END>
<BEGIN> had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they <END>
<BEGIN> had gained . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter viii . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , <END>
<BEGIN> instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for <END>
<BEGIN> the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived <END>
<BEGIN> him . he now wished it more than ever . had he done his duty in that <END>
<BEGIN> respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of <END>
<BEGIN> honour or credit could now be purchased for her . the satisfaction of <END>
<BEGIN> prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be <END>
<BEGIN> her husband , might then have rested in its proper place . <END>
<BEGIN> he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any <END>
<BEGIN> one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in - law , and <END>
<BEGIN> he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his <END>
<BEGIN> assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . <END>
<BEGIN> when first mr . bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son . this son was to join <END>
<BEGIN> in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow <END>
<BEGIN> and younger children would by that means be provided for . five daughters <END>
<BEGIN> successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he <END>
<BEGIN> would . this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too <END>
<BEGIN> late to be saving . mrs . bennet had no turn for economy , and her <END>
<BEGIN> husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their <END>
<BEGIN> income . <END>
<BEGIN> five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs . bennet and <END>
<BEGIN> the children . but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the <END>
<BEGIN> latter , depended on the will of the parents . this was one point , with <END>
<BEGIN> regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr . bennet <END>
<BEGIN> could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . in <END>
<BEGIN> terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though <END>
<BEGIN> expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect <END>
<BEGIN> approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the <END>
<BEGIN> engagements that had been made for him . he had never before supposed <END>
<BEGIN> that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be <END>
<BEGIN> done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present <END>
<BEGIN> arrangement . he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the <END>
<BEGIN> hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket <END>
<BEGIN> allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , <END>
<BEGIN> through her mother ' s hands , lydia ' s expences had been very little within <END>
<BEGIN> that sum . <END>
<BEGIN> that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was <END>
<BEGIN> another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to <END>
<BEGIN> have as little trouble in the business as possible . when the first <END>
<BEGIN> transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were <END>
<BEGIN> over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . his letter was <END>
<BEGIN> soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was <END>
<BEGIN> quick in its execution . he begged to know farther particulars of what he <END>
<BEGIN> was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any <END>
<BEGIN> message to her . <END>
<BEGIN> the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate <END>
<BEGIN> speed through the neighbourhood . it was borne in the latter with decent <END>
<BEGIN> philosophy . to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of <END>
<BEGIN> conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the <END>
<BEGIN> happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm <END>
<BEGIN> house . but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the <END>
<BEGIN> good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from <END>
<BEGIN> all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit <END>
<BEGIN> in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her <END>
<BEGIN> misery was considered certain . <END>
<BEGIN> it was a fortnight since mrs . bennet had been down stairs , but on this <END>
<BEGIN> happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in <END>
<BEGIN> spirits oppressively high . no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her <END>
<BEGIN> triumph . the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of <END>
<BEGIN> her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of <END>
<BEGIN> accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those <END>
<BEGIN> attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and <END>
<BEGIN> servants . she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a <END>
<BEGIN> proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering <END>
<BEGIN> what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and <END>
<BEGIN> importance . <END>
<BEGIN> " haye park might do said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the <END>
<BEGIN> great house at stoke , if the drawing room were larger ; but ashworth is <END>
<BEGIN> too far off ! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for <END>
<BEGIN> purvis lodge , the attics are <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the <END>
<BEGIN> servants remained . but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and <END>
<BEGIN> daughter , let us come to a right understanding . into _ one _ house in this <END>
<BEGIN> neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance . i will not encourage <END>
<BEGIN> the impudence of either , by receiving them at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr . bennet was firm : it <END>
<BEGIN> soon led to another ; and mrs . bennet found , with amazement and horror , <END>
<BEGIN> that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his <END>
<BEGIN> daughter . he protested that she should receive from him no mark of <END>
<BEGIN> affection whatever , on the occasion . mrs . bennet could hardly comprehend <END>
<BEGIN> it . that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable <END>
<BEGIN> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her <END>
<BEGIN> marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe <END>
<BEGIN> possible . she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new <END>
<BEGIN> clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of <END>
<BEGIN> shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they <END>
<BEGIN> took place . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of <END>
<BEGIN> the moment , been led to make mr . darcy acquainted with their fears for <END>
<BEGIN> her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper <END>
<BEGIN> termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its <END>
<BEGIN> unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the <END>
<BEGIN> spot . <END>
<BEGIN> she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . there were <END>
<BEGIN> few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; <END>
<BEGIN> but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s <END>
<BEGIN> frailty would have mortified her so much . not , however , from any fear of <END>
<BEGIN> disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there <END>
<BEGIN> seemed a gulf impassable between them . had lydia ' s marriage been <END>
<BEGIN> concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other <END>
<BEGIN> objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the <END>
<BEGIN> nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . <END>
<BEGIN> from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . the <END>
<BEGIN> wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his <END>
<BEGIN> feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a <END>
<BEGIN> blow as this . she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she <END>
<BEGIN> hardly knew of what . she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no <END>
<BEGIN> longer hope to be benefited by it . she wanted to hear of him , when there <END>
<BEGIN> seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . she was convinced that <END>
<BEGIN> she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they <END>
<BEGIN> should meet . <END>
<BEGIN> what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the <END>
<BEGIN> proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now <END>
<BEGIN> have been gladly and gratefully received ! he was as generous , she <END>
<BEGIN> doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . but while he was mortal , <END>
<BEGIN> there must be a triumph . <END>
<BEGIN> she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in <END>
<BEGIN> disposition and talents , would most suit her . his understanding and <END>
<BEGIN> temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . it <END>
<BEGIN> was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease <END>
<BEGIN> and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , <END>
<BEGIN> and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must <END>
<BEGIN> have received benefit of greater importance . <END>
<BEGIN> but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what <END>
<BEGIN> connubial felicity really was . an union of a different tendency , and <END>
<BEGIN> precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their <END>
<BEGIN> family . <END>
<BEGIN> how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , <END>
<BEGIN> she could not imagine . but how little of permanent happiness could <END>
<BEGIN> belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions <END>
<BEGIN> were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . <END>
<BEGIN> * * * * * <END>
<BEGIN> mr . gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . to mr . bennet ' s <END>
<BEGIN> acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to <END>
<BEGIN> promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties <END>
<BEGIN> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . the principal <END>
<BEGIN> purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr . wickham had resolved <END>
<BEGIN> on quitting the militia . <END>
<BEGIN> " it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added , " as soon <END>
<BEGIN> as his marriage was fixed on . and i think you will agree with me , <END>
<BEGIN> in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both <END>
<BEGIN> on his account and my niece ' s . it is mr . wickham ' s intention to go <END>
<BEGIN> into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still <END>
<BEGIN> some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . he has the <END>
<BEGIN> promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment , now quartered in <END>
<BEGIN> the north . it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of <END>
<BEGIN> the kingdom . he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , <END>
<BEGIN> where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be <END>
<BEGIN> more prudent . i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of <END>
<BEGIN> our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the <END>
<BEGIN> various creditors of mr . wickham in and near brighton , with <END>
<BEGIN> assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself . and <END>
<BEGIN> will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances <END>
<BEGIN> to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , <END>
<BEGIN> according to his information . he has given in all his debts ; i hope <END>
<BEGIN> at least he has not deceived us . haggerston has our directions , and <END>
<BEGIN> all will be completed in a week . they will then join his regiment , <END>
<BEGIN> unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , <END>
<BEGIN> before she leaves the south . she is well , and begs to be dutifully <END>
<BEGIN> remembered to you and her <URL> & c . <END>
<BEGIN> " e . <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal <END>
<BEGIN> from the shire , as clearly as mr . gardiner could do . but mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet , was not so well pleased with it . lydia ' s being settled in the <END>
<BEGIN> north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her <END>
<BEGIN> company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in <END>
<BEGIN> hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a <END>
<BEGIN> pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted <END>
<BEGIN> with every body , and had so many favourites . <END>
<BEGIN> " she is so fond of mrs . forster said she , " it will be quite shocking <END>
<BEGIN> to send her away ! and there are several of the young men , too , that she <END>
<BEGIN> likes very much . the officers may not be so pleasant in general s <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> his daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being <END>
<BEGIN> admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , <END>
<BEGIN> received at first an absolute negative . but jane and elizabeth , who <END>
<BEGIN> agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and <END>
<BEGIN> consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , <END>
<BEGIN> urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her <END>
<BEGIN> and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was <END>
<BEGIN> prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . and their <END>
<BEGIN> mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew <END>
<BEGIN> her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to <END>
<BEGIN> the north . when mr . bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he <END>
<BEGIN> sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon <END>
<BEGIN> as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn . elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , <END>
<BEGIN> and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him <END>
<BEGIN> would have been the last object of her wishes . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter ix . <END>
<BEGIN> their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her <END>
<BEGIN> probably more than she felt for herself . the carriage was sent to meet <END>
<BEGIN> them at and they were to return in it , by dinner time . their <END>
<BEGIN> arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , <END>
<BEGIN> who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _ she _ <END>
<BEGIN> been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <END>
<BEGIN> endure . <END>
<BEGIN> they came . the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive <END>
<BEGIN> them . smiles decked the face of mrs . bennet , as the carriage drove up to <END>
<BEGIN> the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , <END>
<BEGIN> anxious , uneasy . <END>
<BEGIN> lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and <END>
<BEGIN> she ran into the room . her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and <END>
<BEGIN> welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an <END>
<BEGIN> alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness . <END>
<BEGIN> their reception from mr . bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite <END>
<BEGIN> so cordial . his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely <END>
<BEGIN> opened his lips . the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was <END>
<BEGIN> enough to provoke him . elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was <END>
<BEGIN> shocked . lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and <END>
<BEGIN> fearless . she turned from sister to sister , demanding their <END>
<BEGIN> congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly <END>
<BEGIN> round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and <END>
<BEGIN> observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been <END>
<BEGIN> there . <END>
<BEGIN> wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners <END>
<BEGIN> were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been <END>
<BEGIN> exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he <END>
<BEGIN> claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . elizabeth had <END>
<BEGIN> not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , <END>
<BEGIN> resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence <END>
<BEGIN> of an impudent man . _ she _ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of <END>
<BEGIN> the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . <END>
<BEGIN> there was no want of discourse . the bride and her mother could neither <END>
<BEGIN> of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , <END>
<BEGIN> with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her <END>
<BEGIN> replies . they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the <END>
<BEGIN> world . nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led <END>
<BEGIN> voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for <END>
<BEGIN> the world . <END>
<BEGIN> " only think of its being three months she cried , " since i went away ; <END>
<BEGIN> it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things <END>
<BEGIN> enough happened in the time . good gracious ! when i went away , i am sure <END>
<BEGIN> i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! though i <END>
<BEGIN> thought it would be very good fun if i <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> her father lifted up his eyes . jane was distressed . elizabeth looked <END>
<BEGIN> expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of <END>
<BEGIN> which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! mamma , do the <END>
<BEGIN> people here abouts know i am married to day ? i was afraid they might <END>
<BEGIN> not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was <END>
<BEGIN> determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to <END>
<BEGIN> him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window <END>
<BEGIN> frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like <END>
<BEGIN> any <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could bear it no longer . she got up , and ran out of the room ; <END>
<BEGIN> and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to <END>
<BEGIN> the dining parlour . she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with <END>
<BEGIN> anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to <END>
<BEGIN> her eldest sister , " ah ! jane , i take your place now , and you must go <END>
<BEGIN> lower , because i am a married <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , <END>
<BEGIN> from which she had been so wholly free at first . her ease and good <END>
<BEGIN> spirits increased . she longed to see mrs . philips , the lucases , and all <END>
<BEGIN> their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs . wickham by <END>
<BEGIN> each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her <END>
<BEGIN> ring and boast of being married , to mrs . hill and the two housemaids . <END>
<BEGIN> " well , mamma said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast <END>
<BEGIN> room , " and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ? i <END>
<BEGIN> am sure my sisters must all envy me . i only hope they may have half my <END>
<BEGIN> good luck . they must all go to brighton . that is the place to get <END>
<BEGIN> husbands . what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " very true ; and if i had my will , we should . but my dear lydia , i don ' t <END>
<BEGIN> at all like your going such a way off . must it be so <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , lord ! yes there is nothing in that . i shall like it of all <END>
<BEGIN> things . you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . we <END>
<BEGIN> shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some <END>
<BEGIN> balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i should like it beyond any thing said her mother . <END>
<BEGIN> " and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters <END>
<BEGIN> behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the <END>
<BEGIN> winter is <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth ; " but i do not <END>
<BEGIN> particularly like your way of getting <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . mr . wickham <END>
<BEGIN> had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join <END>
<BEGIN> his regiment at the end of a fortnight . <END>
<BEGIN> no one but mrs . bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and <END>
<BEGIN> she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and <END>
<BEGIN> having very frequent parties at home . these parties were acceptable to <END>
<BEGIN> all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did <END>
<BEGIN> think , than such as did not . <END>
<BEGIN> wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to <END>
<BEGIN> find it ; not equal to lydia ' s for him . she had scarcely needed her <END>
<BEGIN> present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that <END>
<BEGIN> their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather <END>
<BEGIN> than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring <END>
<BEGIN> for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain <END>
<BEGIN> that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and <END>
<BEGIN> if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity <END>
<BEGIN> of having a companion . <END>
<BEGIN> lydia was exceedingly fond of him . he was her dear wickham on every <END>
<BEGIN> occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . he did every <END>
<BEGIN> thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on <END>
<BEGIN> the first of september , than any body else in the country . <END>
<BEGIN> one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two <END>
<BEGIN> elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> " lizzy , i never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , i believe . you were <END>
<BEGIN> not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it . are not you <END>
<BEGIN> curious to hear how it was managed <END>
<BEGIN> " no really replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said <END>
<BEGIN> on the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " la ! you are so strange ! but i must tell you how it went off . we were <END>
<BEGIN> married , you know , at st . clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in <END>
<BEGIN> that parish . and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven <END>
<BEGIN> o ' clock . my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others <END>
<BEGIN> were to meet us at the church . well , monday morning came , and i was in <END>
<BEGIN> such a fuss ! i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put <END>
<BEGIN> it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted . and there was my <END>
<BEGIN> aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if <END>
<BEGIN> she was reading a sermon . however , i did not hear above one word in ten , <END>
<BEGIN> for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham . i longed to <END>
<BEGIN> know whether he would be married in his blue coat . <END>
<BEGIN> " well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never <END>
<BEGIN> be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt <END>
<BEGIN> were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them . if you ' ll believe <END>
<BEGIN> me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a <END>
<BEGIN> fortnight . not one party , or scheme , or any thing . to be sure london was <END>
<BEGIN> rather thin , but however the little theatre was open . well , and so just <END>
<BEGIN> as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business <END>
<BEGIN> to that horrid man mr . stone . and then , you know , when once they get <END>
<BEGIN> together , there is no end of it . well , i was so frightened i did not <END>
<BEGIN> know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond <END>
<BEGIN> the hour , we could not be married all day . but , luckily , he came back <END>
<BEGIN> again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . however , i <END>
<BEGIN> recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the <END>
<BEGIN> wedding need not be put off , for mr . darcy might have done as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " mr . darcy repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , yes he was to come there with wickham , you know . but gracious me ! <END>
<BEGIN> i quite forgot ! i ought not to have said a word about it . i promised <END>
<BEGIN> them so faithfully ! what will wickham say ? it was to be such a secret <END>
<BEGIN> " if it was to be secret said jane , " say not another word on the <END>
<BEGIN> subject . you may depend upon my seeking no <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! certainly said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will <END>
<BEGIN> ask you no <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " thank you said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you <END>
<BEGIN> all , and then wickham would be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her <END>
<BEGIN> power , by running away . <END>
<BEGIN> but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it <END>
<BEGIN> was impossible not to try for information . mr . darcy had been at her <END>
<BEGIN> sister ' s wedding . it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , <END>
<BEGIN> where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . <END>
<BEGIN> conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her <END>
<BEGIN> brain ; but she was satisfied with none . those that best pleased her , as <END>
<BEGIN> placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . she <END>
<BEGIN> could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , <END>
<BEGIN> wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what <END>
<BEGIN> lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been <END>
<BEGIN> intended . <END>
<BEGIN> " you may readily comprehend she added , " what my curiosity must be to <END>
<BEGIN> know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively <END>
<BEGIN> speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such <END>
<BEGIN> a time . pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , <END>
<BEGIN> for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to <END>
<BEGIN> think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " not that i _ shall _ though she added to herself , as she finished the <END>
<BEGIN> letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable <END>
<BEGIN> manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of <END>
<BEGIN> it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any <END>
<BEGIN> satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter x . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as <END>
<BEGIN> soon as she possibly could . she was no sooner in possession of it , than <END>
<BEGIN> hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be <END>
<BEGIN> interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be <END>
<BEGIN> happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not <END>
<BEGIN> contain a denial . <END>
<BEGIN> " gracechurch street , sept . 6 . <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear niece , <END>
<BEGIN> " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole <END>
<BEGIN> morning to answering it , as i foresee that a _ little _ writing will <END>
<BEGIN> not comprise what i have to tell you . i must confess myself <END>
<BEGIN> surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from _ you <END>
<BEGIN> don ' t think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , <END>
<BEGIN> that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _ your _ <END>
<BEGIN> side . if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my <END>
<BEGIN> impertinence . your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing <END>
<BEGIN> but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed <END>
<BEGIN> him to act as he has done . but if you are really innocent and <END>
<BEGIN> ignorant , i must be more explicit . on the very day of my coming <END>
<BEGIN> home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . it was all <END>
<BEGIN> over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked <END>
<BEGIN> as _ your ' s _ seems to have been . he came to tell mr . gardiner that <END>
<BEGIN> he had found out where your sister and mr . wickham were , and that <END>
<BEGIN> he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia <END>
<BEGIN> once . from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day <END>
<BEGIN> after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting <END>
<BEGIN> for them . the motive professed , was his conviction of its being <END>
<BEGIN> owing to himself that wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well <END>
<BEGIN> known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , <END>
<BEGIN> to love or confide in him . he generously imputed the whole to his <END>
<BEGIN> mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath <END>
<BEGIN> him , to lay his private actions open to the world . his character <END>
<BEGIN> was to speak for itself . he called it , therefore , his duty to step <END>
<BEGIN> forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on <END>
<BEGIN> by himself . if he _ had another _ motive , i am sure it would never <END>
<BEGIN> disgrace him . he had been some days in town , before he was able to <END>
<BEGIN> discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was <END>
<BEGIN> more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another <END>
<BEGIN> reason for his resolving to follow us . there is a lady , it seems , a <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was <END>
<BEGIN> dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though <END>
<BEGIN> he did not say what . she then took a large house in edward street , <END>
<BEGIN> and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . this mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he <END>
<BEGIN> went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . but <END>
<BEGIN> it was two or three days before he could get from her what he <END>
<BEGIN> wanted . she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery <END>
<BEGIN> and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be <END>
<BEGIN> found . wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in <END>
<BEGIN> london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they <END>
<BEGIN> would have taken up their abode with her . at length , however , our <END>
<BEGIN> kind friend procured the wished for direction . they were in <END>
<BEGIN> street . he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia . <END>
<BEGIN> his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade <END>
<BEGIN> her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her <END>
<BEGIN> friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , <END>
<BEGIN> offering his assistance , as far as it would go . but he found lydia <END>
<BEGIN> absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . she cared for none <END>
<BEGIN> of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of <END>
<BEGIN> leaving wickham . she was sure they should be married some time or <END>
<BEGIN> other , and it did not much signify when . since such were her <END>
<BEGIN> feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a <END>
<BEGIN> marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he <END>
<BEGIN> easily learnt , had never been _ his _ design . he confessed himself <END>
<BEGIN> obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , <END>
<BEGIN> which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the <END>
<BEGIN> ill consequences of lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone . he <END>
<BEGIN> meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future <END>
<BEGIN> situation , he could conjecture very little about it . he must go <END>
<BEGIN> somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have <END>
<BEGIN> nothing to live on . mr . darcy asked him why he had not married your <END>
<BEGIN> sister at once . though mr . bennet was not imagined to be very rich , <END>
<BEGIN> he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation <END>
<BEGIN> must have been benefited by marriage . but he found , in reply to <END>
<BEGIN> this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more <END>
<BEGIN> effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . <END>
<BEGIN> under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof <END>
<BEGIN> against the temptation of immediate relief . they met several times , <END>
<BEGIN> for there was much to be discussed . wickham of course wanted more <END>
<BEGIN> than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . <END>
<BEGIN> every thing being settled between _ them mr . darcy ' s next step was <END>
<BEGIN> to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in <END>
<BEGIN> gracechurch street the evening before i came home . but mr . gardiner <END>
<BEGIN> could not be seen , and mr . darcy found , on further enquiry , that <END>
<BEGIN> your father was still with him , but would quit town the next <END>
<BEGIN> morning . he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could <END>
<BEGIN> so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed <END>
<BEGIN> seeing him , till after the departure of the former . he did not <END>
<BEGIN> leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a <END>
<BEGIN> gentleman had called on business . on saturday he came again . your <END>
<BEGIN> father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they <END>
<BEGIN> had a great deal of talk together . they met again on sunday , and <END>
<BEGIN> then _ i _ saw him too . it was not all settled before monday : as soon <END>
<BEGIN> as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn . but our visitor <END>
<BEGIN> was very obstinate . i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real <END>
<BEGIN> defect of his character after all . he has been accused of many <END>
<BEGIN> faults at different times ; but _ this _ is the true one . nothing was <END>
<BEGIN> to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do <END>
<BEGIN> not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it your <END>
<BEGIN> uncle would most readily have settled the whole . they battled it <END>
<BEGIN> together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman <END>
<BEGIN> or lady concerned in it deserved . but at last your uncle was forced <END>
<BEGIN> to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , <END>
<BEGIN> was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , <END>
<BEGIN> which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your <END>
<BEGIN> letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an <END>
<BEGIN> explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give <END>
<BEGIN> the praise where it was due . but , lizzy , this must go no farther <END>
<BEGIN> than yourself , or jane at most . you know pretty well , i suppose , <END>
<BEGIN> what has been done for the young people . his debts are to be paid , <END>
<BEGIN> amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , <END>
<BEGIN> another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her and his <END>
<BEGIN> commission purchased . the reason why all this was to be done by him <END>
<BEGIN> alone , was such as i have given above . it was owing to him , to his <END>
<BEGIN> reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham ' s character <END>
<BEGIN> had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been <END>
<BEGIN> received and noticed as he was . perhaps there was some truth in <END>
<BEGIN> _ this though i doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody ' s _ <END>
<BEGIN> reserve , can be answerable for the event . but in spite of all this <END>
<BEGIN> fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that <END>
<BEGIN> your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit <END>
<BEGIN> for _ another interest _ in the affair . when all this was resolved <END>
<BEGIN> on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more <END>
<BEGIN> when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to <END>
<BEGIN> receive the last finish . i believe i have now told you every thing . <END>
<BEGIN> it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i <END>
<BEGIN> hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . lydia came to <END>
<BEGIN> us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house . _ he _ was <END>
<BEGIN> exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i <END>
<BEGIN> would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour <END>
<BEGIN> while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ' s letter <END>
<BEGIN> last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a <END>
<BEGIN> piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no <END>
<BEGIN> fresh pain . i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , <END>
<BEGIN> representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and <END>
<BEGIN> all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . if she heard me , <END>
<BEGIN> it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen . i was <END>
<BEGIN> sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . mr . darcy was <END>
<BEGIN> punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the <END>
<BEGIN> wedding . he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again <END>
<BEGIN> on wednesday or thursday . will you be very angry with me , my dear <END>
<BEGIN> lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold <END>
<BEGIN> enough to say before ) how much i like him . his behaviour to us has , <END>
<BEGIN> in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . <END>
<BEGIN> his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but <END>
<BEGIN> a little more liveliness , and _ that if he marry _ prudently his <END>
<BEGIN> wife may teach him . i thought him very sly he hardly ever <END>
<BEGIN> mentioned your name . but slyness seems the fashion . pray forgive <END>
<BEGIN> me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so <END>
<BEGIN> far , as to exclude me from p . i shall never be quite happy till i <END>
<BEGIN> have been all round the park . a low phaeton , with a nice little <END>
<BEGIN> pair of ponies , would be the very thing . but i must write no more . <END>
<BEGIN> the children have been wanting me this half hour . your ' s , very <END>
<BEGIN> sincerely , <END>
<BEGIN> " m . <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , <END>
<BEGIN> in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the <END>
<BEGIN> greatest share . the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had <END>
<BEGIN> produced of what mr . darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s <END>
<BEGIN> match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too <END>
<BEGIN> great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the <END>
<BEGIN> pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! <END>
<BEGIN> he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the <END>
<BEGIN> trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which <END>
<BEGIN> supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and <END>
<BEGIN> despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , <END>
<BEGIN> persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to <END>
<BEGIN> avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . he had <END>
<BEGIN> done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . her <END>
<BEGIN> heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . but it was a hope <END>
<BEGIN> shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her <END>
<BEGIN> vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for <END>
<BEGIN> her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a <END>
<BEGIN> sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . <END>
<BEGIN> brother in - law of wickham ! every kind of pride must revolt from the <END>
<BEGIN> connection . he had to be sure done much . she was ashamed to think how <END>
<BEGIN> much . but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no <END>
<BEGIN> extraordinary stretch of belief . it was reasonable that he should feel <END>
<BEGIN> he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising <END>
<BEGIN> it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , <END>
<BEGIN> she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might <END>
<BEGIN> assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be <END>
<BEGIN> materially concerned . it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that <END>
<BEGIN> they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a <END>
<BEGIN> return . they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing <END>
<BEGIN> to him . oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation <END>
<BEGIN> she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed <END>
<BEGIN> towards him . for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . <END>
<BEGIN> proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get <END>
<BEGIN> the better of himself . she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him <END>
<BEGIN> again and again . it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . she was even <END>
<BEGIN> sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how <END>
<BEGIN> steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and <END>
<BEGIN> confidence subsisted between mr . darcy and herself . <END>
<BEGIN> she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s <END>
<BEGIN> approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <END>
<BEGIN> overtaken by wickham . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister said he , <END>
<BEGIN> as he joined her . <END>
<BEGIN> " you certainly do she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow <END>
<BEGIN> that the interruption must be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i should be sorry indeed , if it were . _ we _ were always good friends ; <END>
<BEGIN> and now we are <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " true . are the others coming out <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not know . mrs . bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to <END>
<BEGIN> meryton . and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that <END>
<BEGIN> you have actually seen <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she replied in the affirmative . <END>
<BEGIN> " i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much <END>
<BEGIN> for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle . and you saw the <END>
<BEGIN> old housekeeper , i suppose ? poor reynolds , she was always very fond of <END>
<BEGIN> me . but of course she did not mention my name to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , she <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and what did she say <END>
<BEGIN> " that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned <END>
<BEGIN> out well . at such a distance as _ that you know , things are strangely <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " certainly he replied , biting his lips . elizabeth hoped she had <END>
<BEGIN> silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , <END>
<BEGIN> " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month . we passed each other <END>
<BEGIN> several times . i wonder what he can be doing <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said <END>

<BEGIN> " i do not recollect that we <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> me in every <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " how should you have liked making sermons <END>
<BEGIN> " exceedingly well . i should have considered it as part of my duty , and <END>
<BEGIN> the exertion would soon have been nothing . one ought not to <END>
<BEGIN> repine but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! the <END>
<BEGIN> quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas <END>
<BEGIN> of happiness ! but it was not to be . did you ever hear darcy mention the <END>
<BEGIN> circumstance , when you were in kent <END>

<BEGIN> first , you may <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so <END>
<BEGIN> palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually <END>
<BEGIN> declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business <END>
<BEGIN> had been compromised <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . you may remember <END>
<BEGIN> what i told you on that point , when first we talked of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast <END>
<BEGIN> to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , <END>
<BEGIN> she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , <END>
<BEGIN> " come , mr . wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . do not let us <END>
<BEGIN> quarrel about the past . in future , i hope we shall be always of one <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though <END>
<BEGIN> he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xi . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he <END>
<BEGIN> never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she <END>
<BEGIN> had said enough to keep him quiet . <END>
<BEGIN> the day of his and lydia ' s departure soon came , and mrs . bennet was <END>
<BEGIN> forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means <END>
<BEGIN> entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to <END>
<BEGIN> continue at least a twelvemonth . <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! my dear lydia she cried , " when shall we meet again <END>
<BEGIN> " oh , lord ! i don ' t know . not these two or three years <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " write to me very often , my <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> mr . wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s . he <END>
<BEGIN> smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . <END>
<BEGIN> " he is as fine a fellow said mr . bennet , as soon as they were out of <END>
<BEGIN> the house , " as ever i saw . he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us <END>
<BEGIN> all . i am prodigiously proud of him . i defy even sir william lucas <END>
<BEGIN> himself , to produce a more valuable <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the loss of her daughter made mrs . bennet very dull for several days . <END>
<BEGIN> " i often think said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with <END>

<BEGIN> " this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter said <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth . " it must make you better satisfied that your other four are <END>

<BEGIN> " it is no such thing . lydia does not leave me because she is married ; <END>
<BEGIN> but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off . if <END>
<BEGIN> that had been nearer , she would not have gone so <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was <END>
<BEGIN> shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by <END>
<BEGIN> an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . the <END>
<BEGIN> housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the <END>
<BEGIN> arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot <END>
<BEGIN> there for several weeks . mrs . bennet was quite in the fidgets . she <END>
<BEGIN> looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . <END>
<BEGIN> " well , well , and so mr . bingley is coming down , sister ( for mrs . <END>

<BEGIN> i care about it , though . he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure <END>
<BEGIN> _ i _ never want to see him again . but , however , he is very welcome to <END>
<BEGIN> come to netherfield , if he likes it . and who knows what _ may _ happen ? <END>
<BEGIN> but that is nothing to us . you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to <END>
<BEGIN> mention a word about it . and so , is it quite certain he is coming <END>
<BEGIN> " you may depend on it replied the other , " for mrs . nicholls was in <END>
<BEGIN> meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose <END>
<BEGIN> to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . he <END>
<BEGIN> comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday . she was <END>
<BEGIN> going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on <END>
<BEGIN> wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing <END>
<BEGIN> colour . it was many months since she had mentioned his name to <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , <END>
<BEGIN> " i saw you look at me to day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present <END>
<BEGIN> report ; and i know i appeared distressed . but don ' t imagine it was from <END>
<BEGIN> any silly cause . i was only confused for the moment , because i felt <END>
<BEGIN> that i _ should _ be looked at . i do assure you , that the news does not <END>
<BEGIN> affect me either with pleasure or pain . i am glad of one thing , that he <END>
<BEGIN> comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . not that i am afraid <END>
<BEGIN> of _ myself but i dread other people ' s <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth did not know what to make of it . had she not seen him in <END>
<BEGIN> derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no <END>
<BEGIN> other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial <END>
<BEGIN> to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming <END>
<BEGIN> there _ with _ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come <END>
<BEGIN> without it . <END>
<BEGIN> " yet it is hard she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come <END>
<BEGIN> to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this <END>
<BEGIN> speculation ! i _ will _ leave him to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her <END>
<BEGIN> feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily <END>
<BEGIN> perceive that her spirits were affected by it . they were more disturbed , <END>
<BEGIN> more unequal , than she had often seen them . <END>
<BEGIN> the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , <END>
<BEGIN> about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . <END>
<BEGIN> " as soon as ever mr . bingley comes , my dear said mrs . bennet , " you <END>
<BEGIN> will wait on him of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " no , no . you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i <END>
<BEGIN> went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . but it ended in <END>
<BEGIN> nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention <END>
<BEGIN> would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to <END>
<BEGIN> netherfield . <END>
<BEGIN> tis an etiquette i despise said he . " if he wants our society , let <END>
<BEGIN> him seek it . he knows where we live . i will not spend _ my _ hours in <END>
<BEGIN> running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back <END>

<BEGIN> " well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not <END>
<BEGIN> wait on him . but , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine <END>
<BEGIN> here , i am determined . we must have mrs . long and the gouldings soon . <END>
<BEGIN> that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at <END>
<BEGIN> table for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her <END>
<BEGIN> husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her <END>
<BEGIN> neighbours might all see mr . bingley in consequence of it , before _ they _ <END>
<BEGIN> did . as the day of his arrival drew near , <END>
<BEGIN> " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister . " it <END>
<BEGIN> would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can <END>
<BEGIN> hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . my mother means well ; <END>
<BEGIN> but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she <END>
<BEGIN> says . happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over <END>
<BEGIN> " i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth ; " but <END>
<BEGIN> it is wholly out of my power . you must feel it ; and the usual <END>
<BEGIN> satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because <END>
<BEGIN> you have always so <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley arrived . mrs . bennet , through the assistance of servants , <END>
<BEGIN> contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety <END>
<BEGIN> and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . she counted <END>
<BEGIN> the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; <END>
<BEGIN> hopeless of seeing him before . but on the third morning after his <END>
<BEGIN> arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , <END>
<BEGIN> enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . <END>
<BEGIN> her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . jane resolutely <END>
<BEGIN> kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went <END>
<BEGIN> to the window she looked she saw mr . darcy with him , and sat down <END>
<BEGIN> again by her sister . <END>
<BEGIN> " there is a gentleman with him , mamma said kitty ; " who can it be <END>
<BEGIN> " some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " la replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with <END>
<BEGIN> him before . mr . what ' s his name . that tall , proud <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " good gracious ! mr . darcy and so it does i vow . well , any friend of <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must <END>
<BEGIN> say that i hate the very sight of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern . she knew but little <END>
<BEGIN> of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness <END>
<BEGIN> which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time <END>
<BEGIN> after receiving his explanatory letter . both sisters were uncomfortable <END>
<BEGIN> enough . each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their <END>
<BEGIN> mother talked on , of her dislike of mr . darcy , and her resolution to be <END>
<BEGIN> civil to him only as mr . bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either <END>
<BEGIN> of them . but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be <END>
<BEGIN> suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . <END>
<BEGIN> to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and <END>
<BEGIN> whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive <END>
<BEGIN> information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted <END>
<BEGIN> for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an <END>
<BEGIN> interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as <END>
<BEGIN> what jane felt for bingley . her astonishment at his coming at his <END>
<BEGIN> coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , <END>
<BEGIN> was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered <END>
<BEGIN> behaviour in derbyshire . <END>
<BEGIN> the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a <END>
<BEGIN> minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to <END>
<BEGIN> her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and <END>
<BEGIN> wishes must still be unshaken . but she would not be secure . <END>
<BEGIN> " let me first see how he behaves said she ; " it will then be early <END>
<BEGIN> enough for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to <END>
<BEGIN> lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her <END>
<BEGIN> sister , as the servant was approaching the door . jane looked a little <END>
<BEGIN> paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . on the <END>
<BEGIN> gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with <END>
<BEGIN> tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any <END>
<BEGIN> symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down <END>
<BEGIN> again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . she <END>
<BEGIN> had ventured only one glance at darcy . he looked serious as usual ; and <END>
<BEGIN> she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as <END>
<BEGIN> she had seen him at pemberley . but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s <END>
<BEGIN> presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . it was a painful , but <END>
<BEGIN> not an improbable , conjecture . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period <END>
<BEGIN> saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . he was received by mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , <END>
<BEGIN> especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of <END>
<BEGIN> her curtsey and address to his friend . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the <END>
<BEGIN> preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was <END>
<BEGIN> hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill <END>
<BEGIN> applied . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy , after enquiring of her how mr . and mrs . gardiner did , a question <END>
<BEGIN> which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . <END>
<BEGIN> he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; <END>
<BEGIN> but it had not been so in derbyshire . there he had talked to her <END>
<BEGIN> friends , when he could not to herself . but now several minutes elapsed , <END>
<BEGIN> without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable <END>
<BEGIN> to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she <END>
<BEGIN> as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no <END>
<BEGIN> object but the ground . more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please <END>
<BEGIN> than when they last met , were plainly expressed . she was disappointed , <END>
<BEGIN> and angry with herself for being so . <END>
<BEGIN> " could i expect it to be otherwise said she . " yet why did he come <END>
<BEGIN> she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to <END>
<BEGIN> him she had hardly courage to speak . <END>
<BEGIN> she enquired after his sister , but could do no more . <END>
<BEGIN> " it is a long time , mr . bingley , since you went away said mrs . bennet . <END>
<BEGIN> he readily agreed to it . <END>
<BEGIN> " i began to be afraid you would never come back again . people _ did _ say , <END>
<BEGIN> you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope <END>
<BEGIN> it is not true . a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , <END>
<BEGIN> since you went away . miss lucas is married and settled . and one of my <END>
<BEGIN> own daughters . i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have <END>
<BEGIN> seen it in the papers . it was in the times and the courier , i know ; <END>
<BEGIN> though it was not put in as it ought to be . it was only said , ' lately , <END>
<BEGIN> george wickham , esq . to miss lydia bennet without there being a <END>
<BEGIN> syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . <END>
<BEGIN> it was my brother gardiner ' s drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to <END>
<BEGIN> make such an awkward business of it . did you see it <END>
<BEGIN> bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> dared not lift up her eyes . how mr . darcy looked , therefore , she could <END>
<BEGIN> not tell . <END>
<BEGIN> " it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married <END>
<BEGIN> continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr . bingley , it is very <END>
<BEGIN> hard to have her taken such a way from me . they are gone down to <END>
<BEGIN> newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to <END>
<BEGIN> stay , i do not know how long . his regiment is there ; for i suppose you <END>
<BEGIN> have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the <END>
<BEGIN> regulars . thank heaven ! he has _ some _ friends , though perhaps not so <END>
<BEGIN> many as he <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr . darcy , was in such misery <END>
<BEGIN> of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . it drew from her , <END>
<BEGIN> however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually <END>
<BEGIN> done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in <END>
<BEGIN> the country at present . a few weeks , he believed . <END>
<BEGIN> " when you have killed all your own birds , mr . bingley said her mother , <END>
<BEGIN> " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet ' s manor . i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and <END>
<BEGIN> will save all the best of the covies for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious <END>
<BEGIN> attention ! were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had <END>
<BEGIN> flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be <END>
<BEGIN> hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . at that instant she felt , <END>
<BEGIN> that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for <END>
<BEGIN> moments of such painful confusion . <END>
<BEGIN> " the first wish of my heart said she to herself , " is never more to be <END>
<BEGIN> in company with either of them . their society can afford no pleasure , <END>
<BEGIN> that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! let me never see either <END>
<BEGIN> one or the other again <END>
<BEGIN> yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <END>
<BEGIN> compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing <END>
<BEGIN> how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her <END>
<BEGIN> former lover . when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; <END>
<BEGIN> but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . he <END>
<BEGIN> found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as <END>
<BEGIN> unaffected , though not quite so chatty . jane was anxious that no <END>
<BEGIN> difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded <END>
<BEGIN> that she talked as much as ever . but her mind was so busily engaged , <END>
<BEGIN> that she did not always know when she was silent . <END>
<BEGIN> when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . bennet was mindful of her <END>
<BEGIN> intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at <END>
<BEGIN> longbourn in a few days time . <END>
<BEGIN> " you are quite a visit in my debt , mr . bingley she added , " for when <END>
<BEGIN> you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with <END>
<BEGIN> us , as soon as you returned . i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure <END>
<BEGIN> you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep <END>
<BEGIN> your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of <END>
<BEGIN> his concern , at having been prevented by business . they then went away . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine <END>
<BEGIN> there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did <END>
<BEGIN> not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a <END>
<BEGIN> man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and <END>
<BEGIN> pride of one who had ten thousand a year . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xii . <END>
<BEGIN> as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; <END>
<BEGIN> or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that <END>
<BEGIN> must deaden them more . mr . darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her . <END>
<BEGIN> " why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent said she , <END>
<BEGIN> " did he come at all <END>
<BEGIN> she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . <END>
<BEGIN> " he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when <END>
<BEGIN> he was in town ; and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if <END>
<BEGIN> he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teazing , teazing , man ! i will <END>
<BEGIN> think no more about <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach <END>
<BEGIN> of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her <END>
<BEGIN> better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> " now said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> easy . i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by <END>
<BEGIN> his coming . i am glad he dines here on tuesday . it will then be publicly <END>
<BEGIN> seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , very indifferent indeed said elizabeth , laughingly . " oh , jane , <END>
<BEGIN> take <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with <END>
<BEGIN> you as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> * * * * * <END>
<BEGIN> they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs . bennet , in <END>
<BEGIN> the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good <END>
<BEGIN> humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had <END>
<BEGIN> revived . <END>
<BEGIN> on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , <END>
<BEGIN> who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as <END>
<BEGIN> sportsmen , were in very good time . when they repaired to the <END>
<BEGIN> dining room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take <END>
<BEGIN> the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by <END>
<BEGIN> her sister . her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to <END>
<BEGIN> invite him to sit by herself . on entering the room , he seemed to <END>
<BEGIN> hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was <END>
<BEGIN> decided . he placed himself by her . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend . he <END>
<BEGIN> bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that <END>
<BEGIN> bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes <END>
<BEGIN> likewise turned towards mr . darcy , with an expression of half laughing <END>
<BEGIN> alarm . <END>
<BEGIN> his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an <END>
<BEGIN> admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane ' s happiness , and his <END>
<BEGIN> own , would be speedily secured . though she dared not depend upon the <END>
<BEGIN> consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . it <END>
<BEGIN> gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in <END>
<BEGIN> no cheerful humour . mr . darcy was almost as far from her , as the table <END>
<BEGIN> could divide them . he was on one side of her mother . she knew how little <END>
<BEGIN> such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to <END>
<BEGIN> advantage . she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but <END>
<BEGIN> she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and <END>
<BEGIN> cold was their manner , whenever they did . her mother ' s ungraciousness , <END>
<BEGIN> made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind ; <END>
<BEGIN> and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell <END>
<BEGIN> him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of <END>
<BEGIN> the family . <END>
<BEGIN> she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of <END>
<BEGIN> bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away <END>
<BEGIN> without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than <END>
<BEGIN> the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . anxious and <END>
<BEGIN> uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the <END>
<BEGIN> gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her <END>
<BEGIN> uncivil . she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all <END>
<BEGIN> her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . <END>
<BEGIN> " if he does not come to me , _ then said she , " i shall give him up for <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have <END>
<BEGIN> answered her hopes ; but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , <END>
<BEGIN> where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , <END>
<BEGIN> in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , <END>
<BEGIN> which would admit of a chair . and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of <END>
<BEGIN> the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , <END>
<BEGIN> " the men shan ' t come and part us , i am determined . we want none of them ; <END>
<BEGIN> do we <END>
<BEGIN> darcy had walked away to another part of the room . she followed him with <END>
<BEGIN> her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience <END>
<BEGIN> enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself <END>
<BEGIN> for being so silly ! <END>
<BEGIN> " a man who has once been refused ! how could i ever be foolish enough to <END>
<BEGIN> expect a renewal of his love ? is there one among the sex , who would not <END>
<BEGIN> protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? <END>
<BEGIN> there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings <END>
<BEGIN> she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup <END>
<BEGIN> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , <END>
<BEGIN> " is your sister at pemberley still <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , she will remain there till <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and quite alone ? have all her friends left her <END>
<BEGIN> " mrs . annesley is with her . the others have been gone on to scarborough , <END>
<BEGIN> these three <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse <END>
<BEGIN> with her , he might have better success . he stood by her , however , for <END>
<BEGIN> some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering <END>
<BEGIN> to elizabeth again , he walked away . <END>
<BEGIN> when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies <END>
<BEGIN> all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when <END>
<BEGIN> all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her <END>
<BEGIN> mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated <END>
<BEGIN> with the rest of the party . she now lost every expectation of pleasure . <END>
<BEGIN> they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had <END>
<BEGIN> nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side <END>
<BEGIN> of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to <END>
<BEGIN> supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the <END>
<BEGIN> others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . <END>
<BEGIN> " well girls said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what <END>
<BEGIN> say you to the day ? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , <END>
<BEGIN> i assure you . the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw . the <END>
<BEGIN> venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat <END>
<BEGIN> a haunch . the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the <END>
<BEGIN> lucas ' s last week ; and even mr . darcy acknowledged , that the partridges <END>
<BEGIN> were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french <END>
<BEGIN> cooks at least . and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater <END>
<BEGIN> beauty . mrs . long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not . and <END>
<BEGIN> what do you think she said besides ? ' ah ! mrs . bennet , we shall have her <END>
<BEGIN> at netherfield at <URL> she did indeed . i do think mrs . long is as good <END>
<BEGIN> a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , <END>
<BEGIN> and not at all handsome : i like them <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of <END>
<BEGIN> bingley ' s behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at <END>
<BEGIN> last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy <END>
<BEGIN> humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at <END>
<BEGIN> not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . <END>
<BEGIN> " it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth . " the <END>
<BEGIN> party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . i hope we <END>
<BEGIN> may often meet <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth smiled . <END>
<BEGIN> " lizzy , you must not do so . you must not suspect me . it mortifies me . i <END>
<BEGIN> assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an <END>
<BEGIN> agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . i am <END>
<BEGIN> perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any <END>
<BEGIN> design of engaging my affection . it is only that he is blessed with <END>
<BEGIN> greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally <END>
<BEGIN> pleasing than any other <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you are very cruel said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and <END>
<BEGIN> are provoking me to it every <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " how hard it is in some cases to be believed <END>
<BEGIN> " and how impossible in others <END>
<BEGIN> " but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i <END>
<BEGIN> acknowledge <END>
<BEGIN> " that is a question which i hardly know how to answer . we all love to <END>
<BEGIN> instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . forgive <END>
<BEGIN> me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _ me _ your <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xiii . <END>
<BEGIN> a few days after this visit , mr . bingley called again , and alone . his <END>
<BEGIN> friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in <END>
<BEGIN> ten days time . he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably <END>
<BEGIN> good spirits . mrs . bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many <END>
<BEGIN> expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . <END>
<BEGIN> " next time you call said she , " i hope we shall be more <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he should be particularly happy at any time , & c . <URL> and if she would <END>
<BEGIN> give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . <END>
<BEGIN> " can you come to morrow <END>
<BEGIN> yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was <END>
<BEGIN> accepted with alacrity . <END>
<BEGIN> he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them <END>
<BEGIN> dressed . in ran mrs . bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing <END>
<BEGIN> gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down . he is come mr . bingley is <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> is , indeed . make haste , make haste . here , sarah , come to miss <END>
<BEGIN> bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . never mind miss <END>
<BEGIN> lizzy ' s <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " we will be down as soon as we can said jane ; " but i dare say kitty is <END>
<BEGIN> forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick ! <END>
<BEGIN> where is your sash my dear <END>
<BEGIN> but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down <END>
<BEGIN> without one of her sisters . <END>
<BEGIN> the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the <END>
<BEGIN> evening . after tea , mr . bennet retired to the library , as was his <END>
<BEGIN> custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument . two obstacles of the <END>
<BEGIN> five being thus removed , mrs . bennet sat looking and winking at <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any <END>
<BEGIN> impression on them . elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last <END>
<BEGIN> kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ? what do <END>
<BEGIN> you keep winking at me for ? what am i to do <END>
<BEGIN> " nothing child , nothing . i did not wink at <URL> she then sat still five <END>
<BEGIN> minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she <END>
<BEGIN> suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , <END>
<BEGIN> " come here , my love , i want to speak to you took her out of the room . <END>
<BEGIN> jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at <END>
<BEGIN> such premeditation , and her intreaty that _ she _ would not give into it . <END>
<BEGIN> in a few minutes , mrs . bennet half opened the door and called out , <END>
<BEGIN> " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was forced to go . <END>
<BEGIN> " we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as <END>
<BEGIN> soon as she was in the hall . " kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in <END>
<BEGIN> my <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained <END>
<BEGIN> quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned <END>
<BEGIN> into the drawing room . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual . bingley was every <END>
<BEGIN> thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter . his <END>
<BEGIN> ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their <END>
<BEGIN> evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the <END>
<BEGIN> mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command <END>
<BEGIN> of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . <END>
<BEGIN> he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went <END>
<BEGIN> away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . <END>
<BEGIN> after this day , jane said no more of her indifference . not a word passed <END>
<BEGIN> between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in <END>
<BEGIN> the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> returned within the stated time . seriously , however , she felt tolerably <END>
<BEGIN> persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s <END>
<BEGIN> concurrence . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr . bennet spent the <END>
<BEGIN> morning together , as had been agreed on . the latter was much more <END>
<BEGIN> agreeable than his companion expected . there was nothing of presumption <END>
<BEGIN> or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him <END>
<BEGIN> into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the <END>
<BEGIN> other had ever seen him . bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; <END>
<BEGIN> and in the evening mrs . bennet ' s invention was again at work to get <END>
<BEGIN> every body away from him and her daughter . elizabeth , who had a letter <END>
<BEGIN> to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; <END>
<BEGIN> for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be <END>
<BEGIN> wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes . <END>
<BEGIN> but on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she <END>
<BEGIN> saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother <END>
<BEGIN> had been too ingenious for her . on opening the door , she perceived her <END>
<BEGIN> sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in <END>
<BEGIN> earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of <END>
<BEGIN> both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would <END>
<BEGIN> have told it all . _ their _ situation was awkward enough ; but _ her ' s _ she <END>
<BEGIN> thought was still worse . not a syllable was uttered by either ; and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as <END>
<BEGIN> well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few <END>
<BEGIN> words to her sister , ran out of the room . <END>
<BEGIN> jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give <END>
<BEGIN> pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest <END>
<BEGIN> emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . <END>
<BEGIN> tis too much she added , " by far too much . i do not deserve it . oh ! <END>
<BEGIN> why is not every body as happy <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a <END>
<BEGIN> delight , which words could but poorly express . every sentence of <END>
<BEGIN> kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane . but she would not <END>
<BEGIN> allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be <END>
<BEGIN> said , for the present . <END>
<BEGIN> " i must go instantly to my mother she cried . " i would not on any <END>
<BEGIN> account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it <END>
<BEGIN> from any one but myself . he is gone to my father already . oh ! lizzy , to <END>
<BEGIN> know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear <END>
<BEGIN> family ! how shall i bear so much happiness <END>
<BEGIN> she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the <END>
<BEGIN> card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease <END>
<BEGIN> with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many <END>
<BEGIN> previous months of suspense and vexation . <END>
<BEGIN> " and this said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious <END>
<BEGIN> circumspection ! of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! the <END>
<BEGIN> happiest , wisest , most reasonable end <END>
<BEGIN> in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her <END>
<BEGIN> father had been short and to the purpose . <END>
<BEGIN> " where is your sister said he hastily , as he opened the door . <END>
<BEGIN> " with my mother up stairs . she will be down in a moment i dare <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and <END>
<BEGIN> affection of a sister . elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her <END>
<BEGIN> delight in the prospect of their relationship . they shook hands with <END>
<BEGIN> great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen <END>
<BEGIN> to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane ' s perfections ; <END>
<BEGIN> and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his <END>
<BEGIN> expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for <END>
<BEGIN> basis the excellent understanding , and super excellent disposition of <END>
<BEGIN> jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and <END>
<BEGIN> himself . <END>
<BEGIN> it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of <END>
<BEGIN> miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as <END>
<BEGIN> made her look handsomer than ever . kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped <END>
<BEGIN> her turn was coming soon . mrs . bennet could not give her consent , or <END>
<BEGIN> speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , <END>
<BEGIN> though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed <END>
<BEGIN> how really happy he was . <END>
<BEGIN> not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their <END>
<BEGIN> visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he <END>
<BEGIN> turned to his daughter and said , <END>
<BEGIN> " jane , i congratulate you . you will be a very happy <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his <END>
<BEGIN> goodness . <END>
<BEGIN> " you are a good girl he replied , " and i have great pleasure in <END>
<BEGIN> thinking you will be so happily settled . i have not a doubt of your <END>
<BEGIN> doing very well together . your tempers are by no means unlike . you are <END>

<BEGIN> happy ! i am sure i sha ' nt get a wink of sleep all night . i knew how it <END>
<BEGIN> would be . i always said it must be so , at last . i was sure you could not <END>

<BEGIN> mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty <END>
<BEGIN> begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . <END>
<BEGIN> bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; <END>
<BEGIN> coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after <END>
<BEGIN> supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough <END>
<BEGIN> detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought <END>
<BEGIN> himself obliged to accept . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for <END>
<BEGIN> while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; <END>
<BEGIN> but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those <END>
<BEGIN> hours of separation that must sometimes occur . in the absence of jane , <END>
<BEGIN> he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of <END>
<BEGIN> her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of <END>
<BEGIN> relief . <END>
<BEGIN> " he has made me so happy said she , one evening , " by telling me , that <END>
<BEGIN> he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! i had not <END>
<BEGIN> believed it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i suspected as much replied elizabeth . " but how did he account for <END>
<BEGIN> it <END>
<BEGIN> " it must have been his sister ' s doing . they were certainly no friends to <END>
<BEGIN> his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have <END>
<BEGIN> chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . but when they see , <END>
<BEGIN> as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will <END>
<BEGIN> learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we <END>
<BEGIN> can never be what we once were to each <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth , " that i ever <END>
<BEGIN> heard you utter . good girl ! it would vex me , indeed , to see you again <END>
<BEGIN> the dupe of miss bingley ' s pretended <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , <END>
<BEGIN> he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being <END>
<BEGIN> indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again <END>
<BEGIN> " he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and <END>
<BEGIN> the little value he put on his own good qualities . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference <END>
<BEGIN> of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving <END>
<BEGIN> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice <END>
<BEGIN> her against him . <END>
<BEGIN> " i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried <END>
<BEGIN> jane . " oh ! lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed <END>

<BEGIN> the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a <END>
<BEGIN> secret . mrs . bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs . philips , and <END>
<BEGIN> _ she _ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her <END>
<BEGIN> neighbours in meryton . <END>
<BEGIN> the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the <END>
<BEGIN> world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , <END>
<BEGIN> they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xiv . <END>
<BEGIN> one morning , about a week after bingley ' s engagement with jane had been <END>
<BEGIN> formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the <END>
<BEGIN> dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the <END>
<BEGIN> sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the <END>
<BEGIN> lawn . it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <END>
<BEGIN> equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . the horses <END>
<BEGIN> were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who <END>
<BEGIN> preceded it , were familiar to them . as it was certain , however , that <END>
<BEGIN> somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid <END>
<BEGIN> the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the <END>
<BEGIN> shrubbery . they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three <END>
<BEGIN> continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown <END>
<BEGIN> open , and their visitor entered . it was lady catherine de bourgh . <END>
<BEGIN> they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their <END>
<BEGIN> astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even <END>
<BEGIN> inferior to what elizabeth felt . <END>
<BEGIN> she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no <END>
<BEGIN> other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the <END>
<BEGIN> head , and sat down without saying a word . elizabeth had mentioned her <END>
<BEGIN> name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of <END>
<BEGIN> introduction had been made . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such <END>
<BEGIN> high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . after sitting <END>
<BEGIN> for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> " i hope you are well , miss bennet . that lady i suppose is your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . <END>
<BEGIN> " and _ that _ i suppose is one of your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , madam said mrs . bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine . <END>
<BEGIN> " she is my youngest girl but one . my youngest of all , is lately married , <END>
<BEGIN> and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , <END>
<BEGIN> who i believe will soon become a part of the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short <END>
<BEGIN> silence . <END>
<BEGIN> " it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i <END>
<BEGIN> assure you it is much larger than sir william <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in <END>
<BEGIN> summer ; the windows are full <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then <END>
<BEGIN> added , <END>
<BEGIN> " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr . and <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . collins <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , very well . i saw them the night before <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . but no <END>
<BEGIN> letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some <END>
<BEGIN> refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , <END>
<BEGIN> declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness <END>
<BEGIN> on one side of your lawn . i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you <END>
<BEGIN> will favour me with your <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " go , my dear cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the <END>
<BEGIN> different walks . i think she will be pleased with the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , <END>
<BEGIN> attended her noble guest down stairs . as they passed through the hall , <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and <END>
<BEGIN> drawing room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent <END>
<BEGIN> looking rooms , walked on . <END>
<BEGIN> her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her <END>
<BEGIN> waiting woman was in it . they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk <END>
<BEGIN> that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for <END>
<BEGIN> conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and <END>
<BEGIN> disagreeable . <END>
<BEGIN> " how could i ever think her like her nephew said she , as she looked in <END>
<BEGIN> her face . <END>
<BEGIN> as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following <END>
<BEGIN> manner <END>
<BEGIN> " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my <END>
<BEGIN> journey hither . your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . <END>
<BEGIN> " indeed , you are mistaken , madam . i have not been at all able to account <END>
<BEGIN> for the honour of seeing you <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " miss bennet replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to <END>
<BEGIN> know , that i am not to be trifled with . but however insincere _ you _ may <END>
<BEGIN> choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so . my character has ever been <END>
<BEGIN> celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such <END>
<BEGIN> moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it . a report of a most <END>
<BEGIN> alarming nature , reached me two days ago . i was told , that not only your <END>
<BEGIN> sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that <END>
<BEGIN> _ you that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon <END>
<BEGIN> afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr . darcy . though i <END>
<BEGIN> _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him <END>
<BEGIN> so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on <END>
<BEGIN> setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth , colouring <END>
<BEGIN> with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming <END>
<BEGIN> so far . what could your ladyship propose by it <END>
<BEGIN> " at once to insist upon having such a report universally <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family said elizabeth , <END>
<BEGIN> coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report <END>
<BEGIN> is in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? has it not been <END>
<BEGIN> industriously circulated by yourselves ? do you not know that such a <END>
<BEGIN> report is spread abroad <END>

<BEGIN> " and can you likewise declare , that there is no _ foundation _ for it <END>
<BEGIN> " i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . _ you _ <END>
<BEGIN> may ask questions , which _ i _ shall not choose to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " this is not to be borne . miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied . has <END>

<BEGIN> " it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his <END>

<BEGIN> " if i have , i shall be the last person to confess <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such <END>

<BEGIN> " but you are not entitled to know _ mine nor will such behaviour as <END>

<BEGIN> " only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will <END>
<BEGIN> make an offer to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , <END>
<BEGIN> " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . from their infancy , <END>
<BEGIN> they have been intended for each other . it was the favourite wish of <END>
<BEGIN> _ his _ mother , as well as of her ' s . while in their cradles , we planned <END>
<BEGIN> the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would <END>
<BEGIN> be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of <END>
<BEGIN> inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to <END>
<BEGIN> the family ! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? to his <END>
<BEGIN> tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of <END>
<BEGIN> propriety and delicacy ? have you not heard me say , that from his <END>
<BEGIN> earliest hours he was destined for his cousin <END>
<BEGIN> " yes , and i had heard it before . but what is that to me ? if there is no <END>
<BEGIN> other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be <END>
<BEGIN> kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry <END>
<BEGIN> miss de bourgh . you both did as much as you could , in planning the <END>
<BEGIN> marriage . its completion depended on others . if mr . darcy is neither by <END>
<BEGIN> honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make <END>
<BEGIN> another choice ? and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him <END>
<BEGIN> " because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . yes , miss <END>
<BEGIN> bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or <END>

<BEGIN> by any of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth . " but the wife of mr . <END>

<BEGIN> chapter xv . <END>
<BEGIN> the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many <END>
<BEGIN> hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . lady catherine it <END>
<BEGIN> appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , <END>
<BEGIN> for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy . it was a rational scheme to be sure ! but from what the report of <END>
<BEGIN> their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; <END>
<BEGIN> till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of bingley , <END>
<BEGIN> and _ her _ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the <END>
<BEGIN> expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply <END>
<BEGIN> the idea . she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her <END>
<BEGIN> sister must bring them more frequently together . and her neighbours at <END>
<BEGIN> lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the <END>
<BEGIN> collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only <END>
<BEGIN> set _ that _ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _ she _ had looked <END>
<BEGIN> forward to as possible , at some future time . <END>
<BEGIN> in revolving lady catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help <END>
<BEGIN> feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting <END>
<BEGIN> in this interference . from what she had said of her resolution to <END>
<BEGIN> prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate <END>
<BEGIN> an application to her nephew ; and how _ he _ might take a similar <END>
<BEGIN> representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared <END>
<BEGIN> not pronounce . she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his <END>
<BEGIN> aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose <END>
<BEGIN> that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _ she _ could do ; and it <END>
<BEGIN> was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one <END>
<BEGIN> whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would <END>
<BEGIN> address him on his weakest side . with his notions of dignity , he would <END>
<BEGIN> probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak <END>
<BEGIN> and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning . <END>
<BEGIN> if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often <END>
<BEGIN> seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might <END>
<BEGIN> settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity <END>
<BEGIN> unblemished could make him . in that case he would return no more . lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to <END>

<BEGIN> the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her <END>

<BEGIN> the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous <END>
<BEGIN> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; <END>
<BEGIN> and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained <END>
<BEGIN> himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to <END>
<BEGIN> herself ; when her father continued , <END>
<BEGIN> " you look conscious . young ladies have great penetration in such matters <END>
<BEGIN> as these ; but i think i may defy even _ your _ sagacity , to discover the <END>

<BEGIN> " something very much to the purpose of course . he begins with <END>
<BEGIN> congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of <END>
<BEGIN> which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , gossiping <END>
<BEGIN> lucases . i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says <END>
<BEGIN> on that point . what relates to yourself , is as follows . " having thus <END>
<BEGIN> offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs . collins and myself on <END>
<BEGIN> this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : <END>
<BEGIN> of which we have been advertised by the same authority . your daughter <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after <END>
<BEGIN> her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , <END>
<BEGIN> may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious <END>
<BEGIN> personages in this <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of <END>
<BEGIN> mortal can most desire splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive <END>
<BEGIN> patronage . yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate <END>
<BEGIN> closure with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be <END>
<BEGIN> inclined to take immediate advantage <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my motive for cautioning you , is as follows . we have reason to imagine <END>
<BEGIN> that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with <END>
<BEGIN> a friendly <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy you see , is the man ! now , lizzy , i think i _ have _ <END>
<BEGIN> surprised you . could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within <END>
<BEGIN> the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more <END>
<BEGIN> effectually to what they related ? mr . darcy , who never looks at any <END>
<BEGIN> woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in <END>
<BEGIN> his life ! it is admirable <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force <END>
<BEGIN> one most reluctant smile . never had his wit been directed in a manner so <END>
<BEGIN> little agreeable to her . <END>

<BEGIN> " oh ! yes . pray read <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last <END>
<BEGIN> night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she <END>
<BEGIN> felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some <END>
<BEGIN> family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her <END>
<BEGIN> consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . i thought it my duty <END>
<BEGIN> to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and <END>
<BEGIN> her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run <END>
<BEGIN> hastily into a marriage which has not been properly <URL> " mr . <END>
<BEGIN> collins moreover adds " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia ' s sad <END>
<BEGIN> business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their <END>
<BEGIN> living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally <END>
<BEGIN> known . i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain <END>
<BEGIN> from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young <END>
<BEGIN> couple into your house as soon as they were married . it was an <END>
<BEGIN> encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should <END>
<BEGIN> very strenuously have opposed it . you ought certainly to forgive them as <END>
<BEGIN> a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names <END>
<BEGIN> to be mentioned in your <URL> that _ is his notion of christian <END>
<BEGIN> forgiveness ! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte ' s <END>
<BEGIN> situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch . but , lizzy , you <END>
<BEGIN> look as if you did not enjoy it . you are not going to be _ missish i <END>
<BEGIN> hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . for what do we <END>
<BEGIN> live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our <END>
<BEGIN> turn <END>
<BEGIN> " oh cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted . but it is so <END>
<BEGIN> strange <END>
<BEGIN> " yes that _ is what makes it amusing . had they fixed on any other man <END>
<BEGIN> it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference , and _ your _ <END>
<BEGIN> pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! much as i abominate <END>
<BEGIN> writing , i would not give up mr . collins ' s correspondence for any <END>
<BEGIN> consideration . nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving <END>
<BEGIN> him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and <END>
<BEGIN> hypocrisy of my son in - law . and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine <END>
<BEGIN> about this report ? did she call to refuse her consent <END>
<BEGIN> to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had <END>
<BEGIN> been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his <END>
<BEGIN> repeating it . elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her <END>
<BEGIN> feelings appear what they were not . it was necessary to laugh , when she <END>
<BEGIN> would rather have cried . her father had most cruelly mortified her , by <END>
<BEGIN> what he said of mr . darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but <END>
<BEGIN> wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of <END>
<BEGIN> his seeing too _ little she might have fancied too _ much <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xvi . <END>
<BEGIN> instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth half expected mr . bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy <END>
<BEGIN> with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine ' s <END>
<BEGIN> visit . the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs . bennet had time to <END>
<BEGIN> tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in <END>
<BEGIN> momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed <END>
<BEGIN> their all walking out . it was agreed to . mrs . bennet was not in the <END>
<BEGIN> habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five <END>
<BEGIN> set off together . bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to <END>
<BEGIN> outstrip them . they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , <END>
<BEGIN> were to entertain each other . very little was said by either ; kitty was <END>
<BEGIN> too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a <END>
<BEGIN> desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . <END>
<BEGIN> they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon <END>
<BEGIN> maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , <END>
<BEGIN> when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone . now was the <END>
<BEGIN> moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was <END>
<BEGIN> high , she immediately said , <END>
<BEGIN> " mr . darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving <END>
<BEGIN> relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your ' s . i <END>
<BEGIN> can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor <END>
<BEGIN> sister . ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to <END>
<BEGIN> acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it . were it known to the rest <END>
<BEGIN> of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i am sorry , exceedingly sorry replied darcy , in a tone of surprise <END>
<BEGIN> and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a <END>
<BEGIN> mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . i did not think mrs . <END>
<BEGIN> gardiner was so little to be <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you must not blame my aunt . lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to <END>
<BEGIN> me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could <END>
<BEGIN> not rest till i knew the particulars . let me thank you again and again , <END>
<BEGIN> in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced <END>
<BEGIN> you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the <END>
<BEGIN> sake of discovering <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " if you _ will _ thank me he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . <END>
<BEGIN> that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other <END>
<BEGIN> inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny . but your <END>
<BEGIN> _ family _ owe me nothing . much as i respect them , i believe , i thought <END>
<BEGIN> only of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . after a short pause , <END>
<BEGIN> her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me . if your <END>
<BEGIN> feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once . _ my _ <END>
<BEGIN> affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence <END>
<BEGIN> me on this subject for <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of <END>
<BEGIN> his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not <END>
<BEGIN> very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone <END>
<BEGIN> so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make <END>
<BEGIN> her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . the <END>
<BEGIN> happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never <END>
<BEGIN> felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as <END>
<BEGIN> warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . had elizabeth <END>
<BEGIN> been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the <END>
<BEGIN> expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; <END>
<BEGIN> but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of <END>
<BEGIN> feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his <END>
<BEGIN> affection every moment more valuable . <END>
<BEGIN> they walked on , without knowing in what direction . there was too much to <END>
<BEGIN> be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . she <END>
<BEGIN> soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding <END>
<BEGIN> to the efforts of his aunt , who _ did _ call on him in her return through <END>
<BEGIN> london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the <END>
<BEGIN> substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on <END>
<BEGIN> every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , <END>
<BEGIN> peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that <END>
<BEGIN> such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from <END>
<BEGIN> her nephew , which _ she _ had refused to give . but , unluckily for her <END>
<BEGIN> ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise . <END>
<BEGIN> " it taught me to hope said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself <END>
<BEGIN> to hope before . i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , <END>
<BEGIN> had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have <END>
<BEGIN> acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of <END>
<BEGIN> my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that after abusing you so <END>
<BEGIN> abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all <END>
<BEGIN> your <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> unpardonable . i cannot think of it without <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that <END>
<BEGIN> evening said elizabeth . " the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , <END>

<BEGIN> in <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a <END>
<BEGIN> more gentleman like <URL> those were your words . you know not , you <END>
<BEGIN> can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me though it was some <END>

<BEGIN> all . i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> darcy mentioned his letter . " did it said he , " did it _ soon _ make you <END>
<BEGIN> think better of me ? did you , on reading it , give any credit to its <END>
<BEGIN> contents <END>
<BEGIN> she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her <END>
<BEGIN> former prejudices had been removed . <END>
<BEGIN> " i knew said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was <END>
<BEGIN> necessary . i hope you have destroyed the letter . there was one part <END>
<BEGIN> especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the <END>

<BEGIN> justly make you hate <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> changed as that <URL> <END>

<BEGIN> dreadful bitterness of <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . the <END>
<BEGIN> adieu is charity itself . but think no more of the letter . the feelings <END>
<BEGIN> of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so <END>
<BEGIN> widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant <END>

<BEGIN> ignorance . but with _ me it is not so . painful recollections will <END>
<BEGIN> intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled . i have been a <END>
<BEGIN> selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . as a <END>
<BEGIN> child i was taught what was _ right but i was not taught to correct my <END>

<BEGIN> " my dearest sister , now _ be _ be serious . i want to talk very seriously . <END>
<BEGIN> let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay . will you tell <END>
<BEGIN> me how long you have loved him <END>
<BEGIN> " it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began . <END>
<BEGIN> but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds <END>
<BEGIN> at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the <END>
<BEGIN> desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of <END>
<BEGIN> attachment . when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing <END>
<BEGIN> farther to wish . <END>
<BEGIN> " now i am quite happy said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . i <END>
<BEGIN> always had a value for him . were it for nothing but his love of you , i <END>
<BEGIN> must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley ' s friend and your <END>
<BEGIN> husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me . but <END>
<BEGIN> lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . how little did you <END>
<BEGIN> tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! i owe all that i know <END>
<BEGIN> of it , to another , not to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . she had been unwilling to <END>
<BEGIN> mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made <END>
<BEGIN> her equally avoid the name of his friend . but now she would no longer <END>
<BEGIN> conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage . all was acknowledged , <END>
<BEGIN> and half the night spent in conversation . <END>
<BEGIN> * * * * * <END>
<BEGIN> " good gracious cried mrs . bennet , as she stood at a window the next <END>
<BEGIN> morning , " if that disagreeable mr . darcy is not coming here again with <END>
<BEGIN> our dear bingley ! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always <END>
<BEGIN> coming here ? i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or <END>
<BEGIN> other , and not disturb us with his company . what shall we do with him ? <END>
<BEGIN> lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet <END>
<BEGIN> was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <END>
<BEGIN> epithet . <END>
<BEGIN> as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and <END>
<BEGIN> shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; <END>
<BEGIN> and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr . bennet , have you no more lanes <END>
<BEGIN> hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day <END>
<BEGIN> " i advise mr . darcy , and lizzy , and kitty said mrs . bennet , " to walk <END>
<BEGIN> to oakham mount this morning . it is a nice long walk , and mr . darcy has <END>
<BEGIN> never seen the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " it may do very well for the others replied mr . bingley ; " but i am <END>
<BEGIN> sure it will be too much for kitty . wont it , kitty <END>
<BEGIN> kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . darcy professed a great <END>
<BEGIN> curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently <END>
<BEGIN> consented . as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs . bennet followed her , <END>
<BEGIN> saying , <END>
<BEGIN> " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that <END>
<BEGIN> disagreeable man all to yourself . but i hope you will not mind it : it is <END>
<BEGIN> all for jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to <END>
<BEGIN> him , except just now and then . so , do not put yourself to <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> during their walk , it was resolved that mr . bennet ' s consent should be <END>
<BEGIN> asked in the course of the evening . elizabeth reserved to herself the <END>
<BEGIN> application for her mother ' s . she could not determine how her mother <END>
<BEGIN> would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur <END>
<BEGIN> would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . but whether she <END>
<BEGIN> were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it <END>
<BEGIN> was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to <END>
<BEGIN> her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr . darcy should hear the <END>
<BEGIN> first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her <END>
<BEGIN> disapprobation . <END>
<BEGIN> * * * * * <END>
<BEGIN> in the evening , soon after mr . bennet withdrew to the library , she saw <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was <END>
<BEGIN> extreme . she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to <END>
<BEGIN> be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _ she <END>
<BEGIN> his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be <END>
<BEGIN> filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched <END>
<BEGIN> reflection , and she sat in misery till mr . darcy appeared again , when , <END>
<BEGIN> looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . in a few minutes <END>
<BEGIN> he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while <END>
<BEGIN> pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he <END>
<BEGIN> wants you in the <URL> she was gone directly . <END>
<BEGIN> her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . <END>
<BEGIN> " lizzy said he , " what are you doing ? are you out of your senses , to be <END>
<BEGIN> accepting this man ? have not you always hated him <END>
<BEGIN> how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more <END>
<BEGIN> reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! it would have spared her from <END>
<BEGIN> explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; <END>
<BEGIN> but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of <END>
<BEGIN> her attachment to mr . darcy . <END>
<BEGIN> " or in other words , you are determined to have him . he is rich , to be <END>
<BEGIN> sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane . <END>
<BEGIN> but will they make you happy <END>
<BEGIN> " have you any other objection said elizabeth , " than your belief of my <END>
<BEGIN> indifference <END>
<BEGIN> " none at all . we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but <END>
<BEGIN> this would be nothing if you really liked <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " i do , i do like him she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him . <END>
<BEGIN> indeed he has no improper pride . he is perfectly amiable . you do not <END>
<BEGIN> know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in <END>
<BEGIN> such <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " lizzy said her father , " i have given him my consent . he is the kind <END>
<BEGIN> of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he <END>
<BEGIN> condescended to ask . i now give it to _ you if you are resolved on <END>
<BEGIN> having him . but let me advise you to think better of it . i know your <END>
<BEGIN> disposition , lizzy . i know that you could be neither happy nor <END>
<BEGIN> respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked <END>
<BEGIN> up to him as a superior . your lively talents would place you in the <END>
<BEGIN> greatest danger in an unequal marriage . you could scarcely escape <END>
<BEGIN> discredit and misery . my child , let me not have the grief of seeing <END>
<BEGIN> _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life . you know not what you are <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; <END>
<BEGIN> and at length , by repeated assurances that mr . darcy was really the <END>
<BEGIN> object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her <END>
<BEGIN> estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that <END>
<BEGIN> his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many <END>
<BEGIN> months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she <END>
<BEGIN> did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . <END>
<BEGIN> " well , my dear said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to <END>
<BEGIN> say . if this be the case , he deserves you . i could not have parted with <END>
<BEGIN> you , my lizzy , to any one less <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> had voluntarily done for lydia . he heard her with astonishment . <END>
<BEGIN> " this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! and so , darcy did every thing ; <END>
<BEGIN> made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him <END>
<BEGIN> his commission ! so much the better . it will save me a world of trouble <END>
<BEGIN> and economy . had it been your uncle ' s doing , i must and _ would _ have <END>
<BEGIN> paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own <END>
<BEGIN> way . i shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will rant and storm about <END>
<BEGIN> his love for you , and there will be an end of the <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading <END>
<BEGIN> mr . collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her <END>
<BEGIN> at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come <END>
<BEGIN> for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after <END>
<BEGIN> half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join <END>
<BEGIN> the others with tolerable composure . every thing was too recent for <END>
<BEGIN> gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any <END>
<BEGIN> thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity <END>
<BEGIN> would come in time . <END>
<BEGIN> when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , <END>
<BEGIN> and made the important communication . its effect was most <END>
<BEGIN> extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs . bennet sat quite still , and <END>
<BEGIN> unable to utter a syllable . nor was it under many , many minutes , that <END>
<BEGIN> she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to <END>
<BEGIN> credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the <END>
<BEGIN> shape of a lover to any of them . she began at length to recover , to <END>
<BEGIN> fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless <END>
<BEGIN> herself . <END>
<BEGIN> " good gracious ! lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! mr . darcy ! who would <END>
<BEGIN> have thought it ! and is it really true ? oh ! my sweetest lizzy ! how rich <END>
<BEGIN> and how great you will be ! what pin money , what jewels , what carriages <END>
<BEGIN> you will have ! jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all . i am so <END>
<BEGIN> pleased so happy . such a charming man so handsome ! so tall oh , my <END>
<BEGIN> dear lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . i <END>
<BEGIN> hope he will overlook it . dear , dear lizzy . a house in town ! every thing <END>
<BEGIN> that is charming ! three daughters married ! ten thousand a year ! oh , <END>
<BEGIN> lord ! what will become of me . i shall go <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , <END>
<BEGIN> soon went away . but before she had been three minutes in her own room , <END>
<BEGIN> her mother followed her . <END>
<BEGIN> " my dearest child she cried , " i can think of nothing else ! ten <END>
<BEGIN> thousand a year , and very likely more ! ' tis as good as a lord ! and a <END>
<BEGIN> special licence . you must and shall be married by a special licence . but <END>
<BEGIN> my dearest love , tell me what dish mr . darcy is particularly fond of , <END>
<BEGIN> that i may have it <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman <END>
<BEGIN> himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain <END>
<BEGIN> possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' <END>
<BEGIN> consent , there was still something to be wished for . but the morrow <END>
<BEGIN> passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs . bennet luckily stood <END>
<BEGIN> in such awe of her intended son in - law , that she ventured not to speak <END>
<BEGIN> to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark <END>
<BEGIN> her deference for his opinion . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get <END>
<BEGIN> acquainted with him ; and mr . bennet soon assured her that he was rising <END>
<BEGIN> every hour in his esteem . <END>
<BEGIN> " i admire all my three sons in - law highly said he . " wickham , perhaps , <END>
<BEGIN> is my favourite ; but i think i shall like _ your _ husband quite as well <END>
<BEGIN> as <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xviii . <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr . <END>
<BEGIN> darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . " how could <END>
<BEGIN> you begin said she . " i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when <END>
<BEGIN> you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first <END>
<BEGIN> place <END>
<BEGIN> " i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which <END>
<BEGIN> laid the foundation . it is too long ago . i was in the middle before i <END>
<BEGIN> knew that i _ had _ <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour <END>
<BEGIN> to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke <END>
<BEGIN> to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . now be sincere ; <END>
<BEGIN> did you admire me for my impertinence <END>
<BEGIN> " for the liveliness of your mind , i <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you may as well call it impertinence at once . it was very little less . <END>
<BEGIN> the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious <END>
<BEGIN> attention . you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking <END>
<BEGIN> and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . i roused , and <END>
<BEGIN> interested you , because i was so unlike _ them had you not been really <END>
<BEGIN> amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you <END>
<BEGIN> took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and <END>
<BEGIN> in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously <END>
<BEGIN> courted you . there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; <END>
<BEGIN> and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly <END>
<BEGIN> reasonable . to be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks <END>
<BEGIN> of _ that _ when they fall in <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was <END>
<BEGIN> ill at netherfield <END>
<BEGIN> " dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ? but make a virtue of it <END>
<BEGIN> by all means . my good qualities are under your protection , and you are <END>
<BEGIN> to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me <END>
<BEGIN> to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may <END>
<BEGIN> be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling <END>
<BEGIN> to come to the point at last . what made you so shy of me , when you first <END>
<BEGIN> called , and afterwards dined here ? why , especially , when you called , did <END>
<BEGIN> you look as if you did not care about me <END>
<BEGIN> " because you were grave and silent , and gave me no <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " but i was <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and so was <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you might have talked to me more when you came to <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " a man who had felt less , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that <END>
<BEGIN> i should be so reasonable as to admit it ! but i wonder how long you <END>
<BEGIN> _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . i wonder when <END>
<BEGIN> you _ would _ have spoken , if i had not asked you ! my resolution of <END>
<BEGIN> thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect . _ too <END>
<BEGIN> much i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort <END>
<BEGIN> springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the <END>
<BEGIN> subject ? this will never <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " you need not distress yourself . the moral will be perfectly fair . lady <END>
<BEGIN> catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of <END>
<BEGIN> removing all my doubts . i am not indebted for my present happiness to <END>
<BEGIN> your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . i was not in a humour to <END>
<BEGIN> wait for any opening of your ' s . my aunt ' s intelligence had given me <END>
<BEGIN> hope , and i was determined at once to know every <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , <END>
<BEGIN> for she loves to be of use . but tell me , what did you come down to <END>
<BEGIN> netherfield for ? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? <END>
<BEGIN> or had you intended any more serious consequence <END>
<BEGIN> " my real purpose was to see _ you and to judge , if i could , whether i <END>
<BEGIN> might ever hope to make you love me . my avowed one , or what i avowed to <END>
<BEGIN> myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , <END>
<BEGIN> and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to <END>
<BEGIN> befall her <END>

<BEGIN> be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done <END>
<BEGIN> <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> " and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and <END>
<BEGIN> admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . but <END>
<BEGIN> i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr . darcy <END>
<BEGIN> had been over rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs . gardiner ' s <END>
<BEGIN> long letter , but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would <END>
<BEGIN> be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt <END>
<BEGIN> had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as <END>
<BEGIN> follows : <END>
<BEGIN> " i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have <END>
<BEGIN> done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but <END>
<BEGIN> to say the truth , i was too cross to write . you supposed more than <END>
<BEGIN> really existed . but _ now _ suppose as much as you chuse ; give a <END>
<BEGIN> loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible <END>
<BEGIN> flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me <END>
<BEGIN> actually married , you cannot greatly err . you must write again very <END>
<BEGIN> soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . i <END>
<BEGIN> thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes . how could i <END>
<BEGIN> be so silly as to wish it ! your idea of the ponies is delightful . <END>
<BEGIN> we will go round the park every day . i am the happiest creature in <END>
<BEGIN> the world . perhaps other people have said so before , but not one <END>
<BEGIN> with such justice . i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i <END>
<BEGIN> laugh . mr . darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can <END>
<BEGIN> spare from me . you are all to come to pemberley at christmas . <END>
<BEGIN> your ' s , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> mr . darcy ' s letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and <END>
<BEGIN> still different from either , was what mr . bennet sent to mr . collins , in <END>
<BEGIN> reply to his last . <END>
<BEGIN> " dear sir , <END>
<BEGIN> " i must trouble you once more for congratulations . elizabeth will <END>
<BEGIN> soon be the wife of mr . darcy . console lady catherine as well as <END>
<BEGIN> you can . but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . he has <END>
<BEGIN> more to give . <END>
<BEGIN> " your ' s sincerely , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching <END>
<BEGIN> marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . she wrote even <END>
<BEGIN> to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her <END>
<BEGIN> former professions of regard . jane was not deceived , but she was <END>
<BEGIN> affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing <END>
<BEGIN> her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . <END>
<BEGIN> the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was <END>
<BEGIN> as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it . four sides of paper were <END>
<BEGIN> insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of <END>
<BEGIN> being loved by her sister . <END>
<BEGIN> before any answer could arrive from mr . collins , or any congratulations <END>
<BEGIN> to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the <END>
<BEGIN> collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge . the reason of this sudden <END>
<BEGIN> removal was soon evident . lady catherine had been rendered so <END>
<BEGIN> exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that <END>
<BEGIN> charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till <END>
<BEGIN> the storm was blown over . at such a moment , the arrival of her friend <END>
<BEGIN> was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their <END>
<BEGIN> meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she <END>
<BEGIN> saw mr . darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her <END>
<BEGIN> husband . he bore it however with admirable calmness . he could even <END>
<BEGIN> listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away <END>
<BEGIN> the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all <END>
<BEGIN> meeting frequently at st . james ' s , with very decent composure . if he did <END>
<BEGIN> shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight . <END>
<BEGIN> mrs . philips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his <END>
<BEGIN> forbearance ; and though mrs . philips , as well as her sister , stood in <END>
<BEGIN> too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley ' s good <END>
<BEGIN> humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar . <END>
<BEGIN> nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all <END>
<BEGIN> likely to make her more elegant . elizabeth did all she could , to shield <END>
<BEGIN> him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him <END>
<BEGIN> to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse <END>
<BEGIN> without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising <END>
<BEGIN> from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it <END>
<BEGIN> added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to <END>
<BEGIN> the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to <END>
<BEGIN> either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley . <END>
<BEGIN> chapter xix . <END>
<BEGIN> happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs . bennet got <END>
<BEGIN> rid of her two most deserving daughters . with what delighted pride she <END>
<BEGIN> afterwards visited mrs . bingley and talked of mrs . darcy may be guessed . <END>
<BEGIN> i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment <END>
<BEGIN> of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , <END>
<BEGIN> produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , <END>
<BEGIN> well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was <END>
<BEGIN> lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in <END>
<BEGIN> so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and <END>
<BEGIN> invariably silly . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her <END>
<BEGIN> drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . he delighted in <END>
<BEGIN> going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected . <END>
<BEGIN> mr . bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth . so near <END>
<BEGIN> a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to <END>
<BEGIN> _ his _ easy temper , or _ her _ affectionate heart . the darling wish of his <END>
<BEGIN> sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county <END>
<BEGIN> to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source <END>
<BEGIN> of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . <END>
<BEGIN> kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with <END>
<BEGIN> her two elder sisters . in society so superior to what she had generally <END>
<BEGIN> known , her improvement was great . she was not of so ungovernable a <END>
<BEGIN> temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she <END>
<BEGIN> became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less <END>
<BEGIN> ignorant , and less insipid . from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s <END>
<BEGIN> society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs . wickham <END>
<BEGIN> frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of <END>
<BEGIN> balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . <END>
<BEGIN> mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily <END>
<BEGIN> drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs . bennet ' s being quite <END>
<BEGIN> unable to sit alone . mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but <END>
<BEGIN> she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no <END>
<BEGIN> longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , <END>
<BEGIN> it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without <END>
<BEGIN> much reluctance . <END>
<BEGIN> as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from <END>
<BEGIN> the marriage of her sisters . he bore with philosophy the conviction that <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude <END>
<BEGIN> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every <END>
<BEGIN> thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on <END>
<BEGIN> to make his fortune . the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received <END>
<BEGIN> from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , <END>
<BEGIN> if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . the letter was to this <END>
<BEGIN> effect : <END>
<BEGIN> " my dear lizzy , <END>
<BEGIN> " i wish you joy . if you love mr . darcy half as well as i do my dear <END>
<BEGIN> wickham , you must be very happy . it is a great comfort to have you <END>
<BEGIN> so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will <END>
<BEGIN> think of us . i am sure wickham would like a place at court very <END>
<BEGIN> much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live <END>
<BEGIN> upon without some help . any place would do , of about three or four <END>
<BEGIN> hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr . darcy about it , <END>

<BEGIN> " yours , <URL> <END>
<BEGIN> as it happened that elizabeth had _ much _ rather not , she endeavoured in <END>
<BEGIN> her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . <END>
<BEGIN> such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice <END>
<BEGIN> of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she <END>
<BEGIN> frequently sent them . it had always been evident to her that such an <END>
<BEGIN> income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in <END>
<BEGIN> their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to <END>
<BEGIN> their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or <END>
<BEGIN> herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance <END>
<BEGIN> towards discharging their bills . their manner of living , even when the <END>
<BEGIN> restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the <END>
<BEGIN> extreme . they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap <END>
<BEGIN> situation , and always spending more than they ought . his affection for <END>
<BEGIN> her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in <END>
<BEGIN> spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to <END>
<BEGIN> reputation which her marriage had given her . <END>
<BEGIN> though darcy could never receive _ him _ at pemberley , yet , for <END>
<BEGIN> elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . lydia was <END>
<BEGIN> occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself <END>
<BEGIN> in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently <END>
<BEGIN> staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he <END>
<BEGIN> proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone . <END>
<BEGIN> miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage ; but as she <END>
<BEGIN> thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she <END>
<BEGIN> dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as <END>
<BEGIN> attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility <END>
<BEGIN> to elizabeth . <END>
<BEGIN> pemberley was now georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters <END>
<BEGIN> was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . they were able to love each <END>
<BEGIN> other , even as well as they intended . georgiana had the highest opinion <END>
<BEGIN> in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an <END>
<BEGIN> astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of <END>
<BEGIN> talking to her brother . he , who had always inspired in herself a respect <END>
<BEGIN> which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open <END>
<BEGIN> pleasantry . her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in <END>
<BEGIN> her way . by elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a <END>
<BEGIN> woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not <END>
<BEGIN> always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . <END>
<BEGIN> lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; <END>
<BEGIN> and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in <END>
<BEGIN> her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him <END>
<BEGIN> language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time <END>
<BEGIN> all intercourse was at an end . but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , <END>
<BEGIN> he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; <END>
<BEGIN> and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her <END>
<BEGIN> resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity <END>
<BEGIN> to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on <END>
<BEGIN> them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had <END>
<BEGIN> received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the <END>
<BEGIN> visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . <END>
<BEGIN> with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . darcy , <END>
<BEGIN> as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever <END>
<BEGIN> sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing <END>
<BEGIN> her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them . <END>
